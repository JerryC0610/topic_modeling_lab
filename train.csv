"The worldwide decline in honeybee colonies during the past 50 years has often been linked to the spread of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and its interaction with certain honeybee viruses. Recently in the United States, dramatic honeybee losses (colony collapse disorder) have been reported; however, there remains no clear explanation for these colony losses, with parasitic mites, viruses, bacteria, and fungal diseases all being proposed as possible candidates. Common characteristics that most failing colonies share is a lack of overt disease symptoms and the disappearance of workers from what appears to be normally functioning colonies. In this study, we used quantitative PCR to monitor the presence of three honeybee viruses, deformed wing virus (DWV), acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), and black queen cell virus (BQCV), during a 1-year period in 15 asymptomatic, varroa mite-positive honeybee colonies in Southern England, and 3 asymptomatic colonies confirmed to be varroa mite free. All colonies with varroa mites underwent control treatments to ensure that mite populations remained low throughout the study. Despite this, multiple virus infections were detected, yet a significant correlation was observed only between DWV viral load and overwintering colony losses. The long-held view has been that DWV is relatively harmless to the overall health status of honeybee colonies unless it is in association with severe varroa mite infestations. Our findings suggest that DWV can potentially act independently of varroa mites to bring about colony losses. Therefore, DWV may be a major factor in overwintering colony losses.","quantitative pcr, risk factors, viral load, epidemiology, disease prevalence"
"Worldwide, almost all state-owned enterprises (SOEs) face a critical choice: whether and when to privatize. An SOE's privatization choice is often complicated by the unique characteristics of transition economies. While market economies feature clearly defined and relatively stable rules of market competition and property rights, in transition economies these factors are evolving and uncertain. In this paper, we first distinguish between macro (economy-level) privatization and micro (firm-level) privatization, and then develop an optimal timing model for firm privatization, taking into consideration a number of important parameters, such as costs, pre- and postprivatization performance, uncertainty, risk considerations, and speed of postprivatization adjustment. We show that the choice of whether and when to privatize is a function of these parameters, which are in turn influenced by both external conditions and firm characteristics.","transition economies, mathematical models, privatization strategies, mathematical model, property rights, market economy"
"COVAMOF is a variability management framework for product families that was developed to reduce the number of iterations required during product derivation and to reduce the dependency on experts. In this paper, we present the results of an experiment with COVAMOF in industry. The results show that with COVAMOF, engineers that are not involved in the product family were now capable of deriving the products in 100% of the cases, compared to 29% of the cases without COVAMOF. For experts, the use of COVAMOF reduced the number of iterations by 42%, and the total derivation time by 38%.","product family engineering, industrial validation, variability management framework, software variability management, total derivation time, product derivation, product family"
"Over the years, Software Engineering has provided software developers with a number of significant innovations that have changed the way we conceive and develop software. This tremendous growth has made it possible the development and operation of extremely complex applications such as air traffic control systems, worldwide airline reservation services, avionics and company-wide information systems. Despite this indisputable success, there are important issues and difficulties that we as researchers and practitioners should take into account to further promote the development of the Software Engineering discipline. They are related to the approach and the attitude we adopt in carrying out our research work. This paper briefly discusses some issues particularly critical to address the limitations and difficulties we are facing. The paper does not have the ambition of being complete and comprehensive. Nor does it propose precise solutions, which indeed require the committed and collective effort of the entire Software Engineering community. It just aims at proposing some arguments and observations for stimulating the discussion and reflection on the future of Software Engineering research.","software engineering research, information system, software development, air traffic control, software engineering"
"Phage libraries can display repertoires of antibodies which are greater in number than the mammalian immune response. However, the selected antibodies often have low binding affinity to their target antigen or hapten (KD below 10(-6) M), which is characteristic of the primary immune repertoire. There is a need for procedures to mimic somatic hypermutation through antigen driven affinity maturation, thereby increasing the affinity of selected immunoglobulins.To investigate the effectiveness of mutation and affinity selection of recombinant antibody genes with mutator E. coli cells, incorporating phage-display strategies.Unique human scFvs were selected from a naive Fd-phage library. These genes were mutated by propagation in mutD5 mutator E. coli cells (mutD5-FIT) which were competent for Fd (M13) based phagemid transfections and generated point mutations (transversions and transitions) in the scFv genes. Individual phage-displayed scFvs were affinity selected from the mutation library and were assayed as soluble scFvs by ELISA and BIAcore for binding to antigen.The in vivo mutation of phage-displayed scFvs in E. coli mutD5-FIT, combined with affinity selection against antigen, produced scFv molecules with improved binding activity. The point mutations which resulted in single amino acid substitutions frequently produced ten fold increases in apparent binding affinity. Structural comparisons revealed that these point mutations were in framework regions (adjacent to the CDRs) and within the CDRs. In one case the apparent affinity of an anti-glycophorin scFv after mutation in the VL framework region close to CDR3 increased by 10(3). However, this increase in apparent affinity was accompanied by an increased propensity to dimerise and form aggregates.A strategy for the rapid affinity maturation of scFv and Fab antibody fragments has been developed which utilises mutator strains of E. coli and incorporates phage display of antibody repertoires (libraries).","escherichia coli, phage display, glycophorin, expression"
"At national, state, and local levels, there is increasing recognition of the importance of identifying and responding to the mental health needs of youths in the juvenile justice system, as policymakers and practitioners struggle to find ways to address causes and correlates of juvenile crime and delinquency. The proposed guidelines for mental health assessment provide explicit information about how, why, and when to obtain mental health information on justice youths at each important juncture in processing.A national group of expert researchers and practitioners convened in April 2002. Experts derived six recommendations, following the expert consensus method, for conducting mental health assessments in juvenile justice settings. Experts had broad experience creating collaborations between juvenile justice, mental health, and child welfare systems and understood the policy and health implications of conducting such assessments in juvenile justice settings.Consensus Conference recommendations regarding screening for emergent risk, screening and assessment of mental health service needs, comprehensive mental health assessment components, assessment before community re-entry, need for periodic reassessment, and staff training are presented.Deriving specific recommendations that can be implemented systematically is a necessary first step toward policy changes that will optimize the standard of care for this vulnerable population.","best practices., screening, consensus conference, best practices, juvenile justice, assessment, 427:752-761. key words: juvenile justice, best practice, mental health"
"In this article, I argue that roles are a key construct for CSCL that demonstrate the interdisciplinary strengths of CSCL as a field. CSCL is a problem-driven field with a history of incorporating different paradigms, and has the advantage of using a design stance to understand phenomena like collaboration and learning that are difficult to study. Roles are understood differently by different disciplines, but the concept of roles serves as a boundary object between the different disciplines within CSCL and highlights potential areas for research.","Roles, Scripting, CSCL, Design-based research methods"
"Algal chlorophyll content and chlorophyll type ratios, as biomarkers of stress, were investigated. Ulva intestinalis and Sargassum angustifolium were sampled at low tide, in the intertidal zone of Bushehr Province in January and May, 2010. The mean concentrations of metals in the algae were in the following order: Pb > Ni > Cu > Cd. High negative correlations between chlorophyll a content (r = -0.84, p < 0.01), chlorophyll c content (r = -0.82, p < 0.01), and ratio of chlorophyll c/a in S. angustifolium (r = -0.93, p < 0.001) and Ni concentration in this algae shows that both the content and ratio of chlorophyll may clearly reflect a negative effect of high metal concentrations in this algae.","Seaweed, Metal, Chlorophyll, Biomarker, Persian Gulf, Iran"
"The component's interaction points with the external world play a fundamental role in the specification of an application's architecture. Current software architecture approaches consider an interaction point as an atomic element in the specification of interconnections, despite the complexity of its structure and the attached behavior. It is not possible in current component models to deal separately with an element of an interaction point when such an element is needed alone for specifying a specific logic. To support such logic and the specification of a wide range of early ideas in the process of elaborating a software system, the Integrated Approach to Software Architecture (IASA) uses an interaction point model which provides facilities to manipulate any structural or behavioral element defining an interaction point. In addition, such facilities represent the fundamental foundation of the native support by IASA of Aspect Oriented Software Architectures (AOSA) specifications.","aspect oriented software architectures, fundamental role, software architecture, atomic element, aspect, fundamental foundation, current component model, interaction point, interaction point model, new approach, access points, behavioral element, port, current software architecture approach, archjava, port modeling, component, software systems, component model"
"This experimental project investigates and validates an innovative method to confine the potential plastic hinge zone of hot-rolled H-shape (or wide-flange) steel column for improved seismic behavior. Based on fundamental mechanics, the concept aims at controlling the local buckling of the flange and web elements of the H-shape steel in the potential plastic hinge region of a column. In the experimental program, six model columns were tested under constant axial load and cyclic lateral forces acting in either the weak or the strong axes. Compared with the conventional H-shape steel model columns, the model columns with their potential plastic hinge zone confined by either steel strips or reinforced concrete cover, exhibited excellent seismic performance with large ductility. Analytical efforts to compare with the test results were also made using simple moment-curvature analysis.","seismic behavior, ductility, cyclic loading, local buckling, energy dissipation, hot-rolled h-shape steel, confinement"
"With nearly 6000 species, Syrphidae represents one of the largest families of Diptera. Their widespread distribution, availability of excellent taxonomic keys for species identification (particularly in Europe), and differences in environmental requirements of larvae are features that promote Syrphidae as potentially good bioindicators. This paper presents a brief description of Syrphid morphology, biology and collection methods, followed by examples of their application as monitors of environmental conditions. Given the high mobility of adults, Syrphidae are probably most suitable for environmental evaluation at a larger scale, e.g., for assessment of landscape diversity. Future research aimed at a better understanding the environmental requirements of both adults and larvae should promote the utilization of these insects as bioindicators.","bioindicators, larval biology, landscape diversity, syrphidae, hoverflies, species identification"
"The use of efficiency or payoff matrix in determining selection of treatment is brought to the attention of clinical psychologists. It is pointed out that a quantitative method for reaching decisions is essential where alternative treatments are available and outcomes are uncertain. The matrix approach demonstrates the necessity for the decision-maker to have information which is not normally available at present. The approach suggests an expansion of the role of the clinical psychologist as diagnostician to include elements of operations research.

"A bottom flange friction device (BFFD) has been developed as an energy dissipation device for self-centering post-tensioned steel beam-to-column connections for moment-resisting frames (MRFs). The BFFD is located beneath the beam to avoid interference with a floor slab. Since the BFFD is attached to only one flange, a connection with a BFFD has an asymmetric behavior with different positive and negative moment capacities. To investigate the behavior of a self-centering MRF with BFFDs, static and dynamic analyses were performed, and the results were compared to those of a similar frame with connections that have a symmetric behavior. It was found that the asymmetric behavior of the MRF with BFFDs leads to increased inelastic strain in the beam top flange, which may lead to beam flange buckling. These inelastic strains can be reduced by using longer top flange reinforcing plates.","steel moment connection, friction, self-centering moment resisting frame, post-tensioning, energy dissipation"
"This paper investigates the relationship between R&D and corporate performance. The study extends previous research by examining the conditions under which firms benefit from R&D; by incorporating in the analysis the varying costs of R&D inputs; and by employing an opportunity-cost approach that estimates the monetary returns to R&D. The findings indicate that industrial research generates revenues that are significantly higher than the returns that other investments yield. The study also resolves previously conflicting results concerning firm size, and offers new insights on the role of technological opportunities that contradict past studies. Although the potential for innovation is greater in high-tech industries, intense R&D competition prevents technologically dynamic firms from enjoying high returns to R&D. By contrast, the results demonstrate that low-tech firms use R&D successfully as part of their strategies, implying that prior research underestimates the importance of R&D for these firms.","research and development, innovation, returns to r&d, opportunity cost"
"Prostate cancer is the second highest caused by cancer-related death among males. microRNAs (miRs) have been reported to participate in carcinogenesis, yet their roles in prostate cancer are rarely studied or investigated. Therefore, the present study attempted to explore the effect of miR-137 in prostate cancer via regulating NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4). Initially, microarray analysis was performed to obtain prostate cancer-related differentially expressed genes and miRs that regulated NOX4, followed by detecting the expression of miR-137 and NOX4 and its target relationship. Moreover, PC-3 cells were transfected with small interfering RNA (siNOX4) and miR-137 mimic for exploring the effect of miR-137 on glycolysis, cell proliferation, and apoptosis in prostate cancer by evaluating lactate production, glucose uptake, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, viability rate, and expression of cleaved caspases 3, 8, and 9, cytochrome c, cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), Bax, and Bcl-2. miR-137 was vital to prostate cancer progression via regulating NOX4. Besides, miR-137 expressed poorly while NOX4 expressed highly in prostate cancer. NOX4 was the target gene of miR-137. Additionally, overexpression of miR-137 and silencing of NOX4 were observed to decrease NOX4 and Bcl-2 protein expression, but increase cleaved caspases 3, 8, and 9, cytochrome c, cleaved-PARP, and Bax protein expression. Furthermore, miR-137 overexpression and NOX4 silencing contributed to decreased lactate production, glucose uptake, ATP production, and cell proliferation, but increased apoptosis rate. Collectively, the present study showed that miR-137 repressed glycolysis in prostate cancer through knockdown of NOX4, which might be a potential theoretical target for prostate cancer treatment.","NADPH oxidase 4, apoptosis, glycolysis, microRNA-137, proliferation, prostate cancer"
"Browsing the DOM tree of an XML document is an act of following the links among the nodes of the DOM tree to find some desired nodes without any knowledge for search. When the structure of the XML document is not known to a user, browsing is the basic operation performed for referring the contents of the XML document. If the size of the XML document is very large, however, using a general-purpose XML parser for browsing the DOM tree of the XML document to access arbitrary node may suffer from the lack of memory space for constructing the large DOM tree. To alleviate this problem, we suggest a method to browse the DOM tree of a very large XML document by splitting the XML document into n small XML documents and generating sequentially the DOM tree of each of those small n XML documents. For later reference, the information of some nodes accessed from the DOM tree already generated has been also kept using the concept of their virtual nodes. With our suggested approach, the memory space necessary for browsing the DOM tree of a very large XML document is reduced such that it can be managed by a personal computer.","basic operation, large dom tree, arbitrary node, dom, general-purpose xml parser, dom tree, very large xml documents, xml, n small xml document, small n xml document, large xml document, xml document, memory space"
"Little is known about racial/ethnic differences in the receipt of treatment for major depression in adolescents. This study examined differences in mental health service use in non-Hispanic white, black, Hispanic, and Asian adolescents who experienced an episode of major depression.Five years of data (2004-2008) were pooled from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health to derive a nationally representative sample of 7,704 adolescents (12-17 years old) diagnosed with major depression in the past year. Racial/ethnic differences were estimated with weighted probit regressions across several measurements of mental health service use controlling for demographics and health status. Additional models assessed whether family income and health insurance status accounted for these differences.The adjusted percentages of blacks (32%), Hispanics (31%), and Asians (19%) who received any treatment for major depression were significantly lower than those of non-Hispanic whites (40%; p < .001). Black, Hispanic, and Asian adolescents were also significantly less likely than non-Hispanic whites to receive prescription medication for major depression, to receive treatment for major depression from a mental health specialist or medical provider, and to receive any mental health treatment in an outpatient setting (p < .01). These differences persisted after adjusting for family income and insurance status.Results indicated low rates of mental health treatment for major depression in all adolescents. Improving access to mental health care for adolescents will also require attention to racial/ethnic subgroups at highest risk for non-receipt of services.","mental health services, depression, ethnicity, race, comparative analysis, mental health, regression analysis, ethnic groups, drug therapy"
"This study tried to evaluate a hypothesis drawn from clinical impressions and from suggestive incidental data of prior research that concerns about body intactness will be reflected in a Wechsler subtest pattern where the Object Assembly (OA) score is lower than those of other subtests. OA scores were found to be significantly lower in children with bodily concerns than in a control group, and there were no other significant differences on other WISC subtests. Rorschachs of adult patients with low and high OA scores were compared and there was a significantly greater percentage of Rorschach responses indicating bodily concern in the group scoring low in OA. These findings are discussed in relation to the assessment of cognitive processes and ego functions in diagnostic testing, the process of clinical inference and prior research on body image.

"An experimental investigation of the seismic behaviour of flush end-plate joints is presented. Eight beam-to-column sub-assemblage specimens are tested under monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. The specimen details were varied to ensure a range of failure modes including both end-plate and bolt yielding. Individual connections displayed the same failure mode in both cyclic and monotonic loading conditions. The experimental results are presented in terms of stiffness, moment capacity, rotation capacity and hysteresis curves. The observed response variables are compared with design values obtained using the mechanical model employed in Eurocode 3. The model is seen to predict the mode of failure well, but to over-predict stiffness and under-predict moment capacity. The implications of the test results for the applicability of this joint type to the earthquake-resistant design of moment-resisting steel frames is discussed.","rotation capacity, cyclic response, moment connections, failure mode"
"Early Clinical Exposure (ECE) programs are an increasingly widespread component of undergraduate medical education. Little systematic research exists on the topic. This report compares the approach and cost/benefits of two parallel ECE programs at the Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University.The two ECE programs were compared using student questionnaires, faculty questionnaires, focus groups and participant-observations.ECE for American medical students in Israel was based upon a semi-structured mentoring relationship with a hospital-based specialist, in which students were able to practice interviewing skills. ECE for Israeli students emphasized structured exposure to a wide variety of primary care settings and informal patient contact. Both ECEs were supplemented by campus-based small group discussion. Students, preceptors and group leaders in both ECEs all reported very high levels of satisfaction and perceived impact on medical training.There appears to be no ""best"" way to conduct ECE. The ECE should be tailored to the specific needs and goals of the student population. Further research and international comparison is needed.","israel, clinical exposure, medical education, clinical education, medical students, innovation., focus group, participant observation"
"Long stretches of ""rare"" codons are known to severely inhibit the efficiency of translation. Understanding the distribution of such rare codons is of critical importance in improving the efficiency of heterologous gene expression systems. Accurate estimates of codon usage take the abundance of each protein into consideration. In this paper, we analyze the correlation between approximate measures of codon usage and the availability of tRNA at various growth rates in E coli. We show that the computationally derived estimates of tRNA isoacceptor concentration enable the finding of poorly translated codons.","e coli, codon usage, codons, frequency, trna, biomedical research, bioinformatics"
"Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) often develop renal manifestations. The majority of cases present as cast nephropathy, amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, and monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease. AL amyloidosis usually involves the glomeruli, blood vessels, and interstitium. It is extremely uncommon to find isolated intratubular deposition of AL amyloid. Our patient presented with rapid worsening of renal function due to isolated intratubular deposition of AL amyloid, where the biopsy revealed amyloid proximal tubulopathy and amyloid cast nephropathy. Our case provides new insights into the complicated pathophysiology of the abnormal light chains in MM. This case is, to our knowledge, the second case of amyloid proximal tubulopathy reported in literature.","Amyloid cast nephropathy, amyloid proximal tubulopathy, amyloidosis, multiple myeloma"
"Heart sounds produce an incessant noise during lung sounds recordings. This noise severely contaminates the breath sounds signal and interferes in the analysis of lung sounds. In this paper, the use of a wavelet transform domain filtering technique as an adaptive de-noising tool, implemented in lung sounds analysis, is presented. The multiresolution representations of the signal, produced by wavelet transform, are used for signal structure extraction. In addition, the use of hard thresholding in the wavelet transform domain results in a separation of the nonstationary part of the input signal (heart sounds) from the stationary one (lung sounds). Thus, the location of the heart sound noise (1st and 2nd heart sound peaks) is automatically detected, without requiring any noise reference signal. Experimental results have shown that the implementation of this wavelet-based filter in lung sound analysis results in an efficient reduction of the superimposed heart sound noise, producing an almost noise-free output signal. Due to its simplicity and its fast implementation the method can easily be used in clinical medicine.","stationary-nonstationary outputs, lung sounds, noise reduction, wavelets, heart sounds, wavelet transform"
"Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to study the effect of adsorption of humic substances onto a goethite-coated mica surface, on the forces between the goethite surface and a silica colloidal probe. The positively charged goethite surface (at pH < 7) resulted in strong adsorption of humic substances. The adsorption process could be controlled by altering the solution concentration, pH and exposure time. Force versus distance curves were measured directly by AFM between a silica sphere colloidal probe and the planar goethite-coated mica surface, with and without the presence of humic substances. The thickness of the adsorbed layer was estimated to be about 5 nm from the force curves. These experiments demonstrate the influence of adsorbed humic substances on the surface charge of goethite, which has direct relevance to the colloid stability of natural aquatic particles.","humic substances, colloid stability, atomic force microscopy, surface charge, goethite"
"A new 1 km global IIASA-IFPRI cropland percentage map for the baseline year 2005 has been developed which integrates a number of individual cropland maps at global to regional to national scales. The individual map products include existing global land cover maps such as GlobCover 2005 and MODIS v.5, regional maps such as AFRICOVER and national maps from mapping agencies and other organizations. The different products are ranked at the national level using crowdsourced data from Geo-Wiki to create a map that reflects the likelihood of cropland. Calibration with national and subnational crop statistics was then undertaken to distribute the cropland within each country and subnational unit. The new IIASA-IFPRI cropland product has been validated using very high-resolution satellite imagery via Geo-Wiki and has an overall accuracy of 82.4%. It has also been compared with the EarthStat cropland product and shows a lower root mean square error on an independent data set collected from Geo-Wiki. The first ever global field size map was produced at the same resolution as the IIASA-IFPRI cropland map based on interpolation of field size data collected via a Geo-Wiki crowdsourcing campaign. A validation exercise of the global field size map revealed satisfactory agreement with control data, particularly given the relatively modest size of the field size data set used to create the map. Both are critical inputs to global agricultural monitoring in the frame of GEOGLAM and will serve the global land modelling and integrated assessment community, in particular for improving land use models that require baseline cropland information.

"Reports of motor polyneuropathies in young cats are scarce. Further, in-depth electrophysiologic evaluation to confirm a motor polyneuropathy in young cats of various breeds other than 2 Bengal cats is lacking.To confirm a motor polyneuropathy in young cats of various breeds.Five young cats with heterogenous chronic or relapsing episodes of weakness.Retrospective case series. Cats were presented for evaluation of generalized neuromuscular disease and underwent electrophysiologic examination including electromyography, nerve conduction, and repetitive nerve stimulation. Minimum database and muscle and nerve biopsy analyses were carried out. Descriptive statistics were performed.Disease onset was at 3 months to 1 year of age and in 5 breeds. The most common clinical sign (5 of 5 cats) was weakness. Additional neurologic deficits consisted of palmigrade and plantigrade posture (4/4), low carriage of the head and tail (4/4), and variable segmental reflex deficits (5/5). Motor nerve conduction studies were abnormal for the ulnar (4/4), peroneal (5/5), and tibial (2/2) nerves (increased latencies, reduced amplitudes, slow velocities). A marked decrement was observed on repetitive nerve stimulation of the peroneal nerve in 3 cats for which autoimmune myasthenia gravis was ruled out. All sensory nerve conduction studies were normal. Histologic evaluation of muscle and nerve biopsies supported heterogenous alterations consistent with motor polyneuropathy with distal nerve fiber loss.Heterogenous motor polyneuropathies should be considered in young cats of any breed and sex that are presented with relapsing or progressive generalized neuromuscular disease.","feline, nerve conduction, neuromuscular, weakness"
"Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) for the diagnosis of biliary atresia in infantile cholestatic jaundice. Methods: Forty-seven consecutive infants with cholestatic jaundice underwent single-shot MRC. The diagnosis of biliary atresia was made by MRC based on the nonvisualization of extrahepatic bile ducts and excluded on the basis of the complete visualization of extrahepatic bile ducts. The final diagnosis of biliary atresia (BA group, n = 23) or nonbiliary atresia (NBA group, n = 24) was established by operation or clinical follow-up until the jaundice resolved. Results: The extrahepatic bile ducts including the gallbladder, the cystic duct, the common bile duct, and the common hepatic duct were visualized in 23 of the 24 infants of the NBA group. The extrahepatic bile ducts, except the gallbladder, were not depicted in any infant of the BA group. MRC had an accuracy of 98%, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96%, for diagnosis of biliary atresia as the cause of infantile cholestatic jaundice. Conclusions: MRC is a very reliable noninvasive imaging modality for the diagnosis of biliary atresia. In infants with cholestatic jaundice and considered for exploratory laparotomy, MRC is recommended to avoid unnecessary surgery.","index words: biliary atresia, cholestatic jaundice, mag- netic resonance cholangiography., magnetic resonance"
"Although it is claimed that, among other features, aspect-oriented programming (AOP) increases understandability and eases the maintenance burden, this technology cannot provide correctness by itself, and thus it also requires the use of systematic verification, validation and testing (VV&T) approaches. With the purpose of producing high quality software, many approaches to apply structural testing criteria for the unit testing of procedural and object-oriented (OO) programs have been proposed. Nevertheless, until now, few works have addressed the application of such criteria to test aspect-oriented programs. In this paper we define a family of control flow and data flow based testing criteria for aspect-oriented programs inspired by the implementation strategy adopted by AspectJ - an aspect-oriented extension of the Java language - and extending a previous work proposed for Java programs. We propose the derivation of a control and data flow model for aspect-oriented programs based upon the static analysis of the object code (the Java bytecode) resulted from the compilation/weaving process. Using this model, called aspect-oriented def-use graph (AODU), traditional and also aspect-oriented testing criteria are defined (called Control and Data Flow Structural Testing Criteria for Aspect-Oriented Programs - CDSTC-AOP). The main idea is that composition of aspect-oriented programs leads to new crosscutting interfaces in several modules of the system, which must be considered for coverage during structural testing. The implementation of a prototype tool - the JaBUTi/AJ tool - to support the proposed criteria and model is presented along with an example. Also, theoretical and practical questions regarding the CDSTC-AOP criteria are discussed.","aspect-oriented program, aspect-oriented testing criterion, aspect-oriented extension, software testing, aspect-oriented programming, java language, structural testing, java bytecode, unit testing, testing criteria, testing aspect-oriented programs, aspect-oriented def-use graph, structural testing criterion, static analysis, aspect oriented, aspect oriented programming, control flow, data flow, object oriented"
"Most infants undergoing an ultrasound to rule out pyloric stenosis will have a negative study, suggesting the low accuracy of clinical assessment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using a Bayesian network to improve the accuracy of diagnosing pyloric stenosis.Records of 118 infants undergoing an ultrasound to rule out pyloric stenosis were reviewed. Data from 88 (75%) infants were used to train a Bayesian decision network that predicted the probability of pyloric stenosis using risk factors, signs, and symptoms of the disease. The emergency department records of the remaining 28 (25%) infants were used to test the network. Two groups of pediatric surgeons and pediatric emergency medicine physicians were asked to predict the probability of pyloric stenosis in the testing set: (1) physicians using the network and (2) physicians using only emergency department records. Accuracy was evaluated using area under the ROC curve (discrimination) and Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) c-statistic (calibration).Physicians using the Bayesian decision network better predicted the probability of pyloric stenosis among infants in the testing set than those not using the network (ROC 0.973 vs 0.882; H-L c-statistic 3.9 [P > .05] vs 24.3 [P < .05]). Physicians using the network would have ordered 22% fewer ultrasounds and missed no cases of pyloric stenosis.The use of a Bayesian decision network may improve the accuracy of physicians diagnosing infants with possible pyloric stenosis. Use of this decision tool may safely reduce the need for imaging among infants with suspected pyloric stenosis.","pyloric stenosis, diagnosis, computed-assisted, bayes theorem, ultrasound, bayesian network"
"This article investigates joint-development activities within online consumer groups. While research on user-innovations within communities exists for open source software as well as for emerging extreme sports like kite-surfing or rodeo kayaking in offline contexts, this study focuses on innovation activities within online consumer communities for basketball shoes, a physical consumer product in a mature market. The research shows that a small number of consumers are highly creative and possess sufficient domain specific skills and motivation to develop new innovative basketball shoes. While many community members state their experiences and problems with existing shoe models, those actively participating in joint-innovation activities tend to be driven by excitement rather than by pure need for product improvement. The high quality and variety of innovations, and general willingness of community members to share their ideas with producers, lead to the discussion of how to integrate creative online communities into a company's innovation process.","consumer goods, new product development, innovation, virtual consumer integration, knowledge creation, online community, innovation process"

"This study presents the development of the ductile detail of a T-stiffener added to existing moment connections. The seismic behavior of the aforementioned detail was investigated analytically as well as experimentally. A new design criterion is developed for a horizontal element of T-stiffener. Results of this study indicate that the crack propagation is eliminated using the new proposed procedure. This means that by utilizing a fillet weld as a replacement for a CJP groove weld in joining the T-stiffener to a beam flange eliminates crack propagation at the tip of the T-stiffener on the beam flange. In the experimental program, the specimens performed well during the test and reached a total story drift angle of 6% radians before experiencing 20% strength degradation.","crack, ductility, t-stiffener, retrofitting, weld, connections, crack propagation"
"In children, lesions of the pancreas often are small, and precise localization is required for optimal surgical management. We have used newer-generation real-time ultrasonography of the pancreas intraoperatively in seven children. Five of these children had hypoglycemia, hyperin-sulinemia, and insulimomas; one had a persistent small pancreatic pseudocyst with a disrupted secondary duct, and one had familial pancreatitis with a remarkably enlarged duct and a stone. Two of the five with adenomas had multiple endoctine neoplasia syndrome I (MEN I syndrome); in them, ultrasonography localized several adenomas preoperatively and several additional adenomas intraoperatively. This allowed a 90% pancreatectomy with enucleation of smak adenomas in the remaining head. One child had a nonpalpable insulinoma deep in the head of the pancreas; intraoperative ultrasonography localized the lesion and permitted successful enucleation. Another child with a small pseudocyst and a disrupted secondary pancreatic duct ultimately required surgical drainage; intraoperative ultrasonography of the inflammatory mass immediately localized the small pseudocyst and thus decreased the operative time. The child with familial pancreatitis appeared to require a surgical drainage procedure; however, intraoperative ultrasonography demonstrated that the stone had passed spontaneously just prior to operation and the duct size had returned to normal, eliminating the neod for the drainage procedure at that time.","intraoperative ultrasonography, pediatric pancreatic lesions, insulinoma, ultrasonography"
"Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a severe form of peripheral artery disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. The primary therapeutic goals in treating CLI are to reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, relieve ischemic pain, heal ulcers, prevent major amputation, and improve quality of life (QoL) and survival. These goals may be achieved by medical therapy, endovascular intervention, open surgery, or amputation and require a multidisciplinary approach including pain management, wound care, risk factors reduction, and treatment of comorbidities. No-option patients are potential candidates for the novel angiogenic therapies. The application of genetic, molecular, and cellular-based modalities, the so-called therapeutic angiogenesis, in the treatment of arterial obstructive diseases has not shown consistent efficacy. This article summarizes the current status related to the management of patients with CLI and discusses the current findings of the emerging modalities for therapeutic angiogenesis.","cell therapy, critical limb ischemia, endovascular therapy, gene therapy, medical therapy, surgical therapy, therapeutic angiogenesis"
"Background: The Emerging Infections Network is a mature electronic network that links Public Health professionals in the Asia Pacific through regular e-mail bulletins and an extensive Web site ( http://www.apec.org/infectious ). Emerging infections is a new area of study; learning materials help foster education. Our objective is to quantify the response of the network to the introduction of distance-learning materials on the Web site. Methods: Distance-learning materials, developed by the University of Washington School of Public Health, were field tested and launched on the site. Publicity was carried out prior to the launch of the materials. Access was tracked prospectively using server counts of page downloads. Results: Web access increased substantially during the month after the materials were launched, especially among Asia based computers. The effect was isolated to the distance-learning pages, and not general to the site. Conclusions: This Web site appears to be responsive to the advertisement and to the materials. Prospective Web-site monitoring proved useful.","web accessibility, distance learning, telecommunications, public health, technology assessment"
"Programming data involving 278 commercial-type programs were collected from 23 medium- to large-scale organizations in order to explore the relationships among variables measuring program type, the testing interface, programming technique, programmer experience, and productivity. Programming technique and programmer experience after 1 year were found to have no impact on productivity, whereas on-line testing was found to reduce productivity. A number of analyses of the data are presented, and their relationship to other studies is discussed.","commercial-type program, large-scale organization, organizational environment, testing interface, programming data, programming technique, on-line testing, programmer experience, programming productivity, programming methodology, program type"
"A macroscopic constitutive law of plastic deformation which accounts for the heterogeneous microstructure of the deforming material is proposed. It consists of a kinematic framework, kinetic equations, and structure evolution equations. The kinematic framework treats the material as a composite consisting of (plastically) soft cells or subgrains and hard cell walls or subgrain boundaries. The kinetic and structure evolution equations remain unspecified at first, the law being developed in a general way towards a system of ordinary differential equations. The proposed framework connects the heterogeneous microstructure with the macroscopic response independently of deformation mode and under arbitrarily varying deformation conditions. Two application examples are presented.","dislocation microstructure, 62.20, 61.72, composite model, plastic deformation, dislocations, microstructures, cell wall, ordinary differential equation, constitutive law, kinetics"
"A new direct relativistic four-component Kramers-restricted multiconfiguration self-consistent-field (KR-MCSCF) code for molecules has been implemented. The program is based upon Kramers-paired spinors and a full implementation of the binary double groups (D(2h)(*) and subgroups). The underlying quaternion algebra for one-electron operators was extended to treat two-electron integrals and density matrices in an efficient and nonredundant way. The iterative procedure is direct with respect to both configurational and spinor variational parameters; this permits the use of large configuration expansions and many basis functions. The relativistic minimum-maximum principle is implemented in a second-order restricted-step optimization algorithm, which provides sharp and well-controlled convergence. This paper focuses on the necessary modifications of nonrelativistic MCSCF methodology to obtain a fully variational KR-MCSCF implementation. The general implementation also allows for the use of molecular integrals from a two-component relativistic Hamiltonian as, for example, the Douglas-Kroll-Hess variants. Several sample applications concern the determination of spectroscopic properties of heavy-element atoms and molecules, demonstrating the influence of spin-orbit coupling in MCSCF approaches to such systems and showing the potential of the new method.","second order, spin orbit coupling, quaternion algebra, electron correlation, maximum principle, diatomic molecule"
"The C-terminal end of collagen XV, restin, has been the focus of several studies, but the functions of full-length collagen XV have remained unknown. We describe here studies on the production, purification, and function of collagen XV and the production of a monoclonal N-terminal antibody to it. Full-length human collagen XV was produced in insect cells using baculoviruses and purified from the cell culture medium. The yield was 15 mg/liter of cell culture medium. The collagen XV was shown to be trimeric, with disulfide bonds in the collagenous region. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy revealed rod-like molecules with a mean length of 241.8 nm and with a globular domain at one end. The globular domain was verified to be the N-terminal end by N-terminal antibody binding. The molecules show flexibility in their conformation, presumably due to the many interruptions in their collagenous domains. The ability of collagen XV to serve as a substrate for cells was tested in cell adhesion assays, and it was shown that cells did not bind to collagen XV-coated surfaces. When added to the culture medium of fibroblasts and fibrosarcoma cells, however, collagen XV rapidly bound to their fibronectin network. Solid phase assays showed that collagen XV binds to fibronectin, laminin, and vitronectin and that it binds to the collagen/gelatin-binding domain of fibronectin. No binding was detected to fibrillar collagens, fibril-associated collagens, or decorin. Interestingly, collagen XV was found to inhibit the adhesion and migration of fibrosarcoma cells when present in fibronectin-containing matrices.","vitronectin, protein binding, extracellular matrix proteins, recombinant proteins, cell adhesion"
"To determine the effect of mode of delivery and perineal injury on sexual function at 6 and 12 months postpartum.Prospective cohort study.Tertiary women's hospital in Melbourne, Australia.A cohort of 440 primigravid women.The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) was completed at first visit (7-19 weeks of gestation), and at 6 and 12 months postpartum.A statistically significant difference in total FSFI or domain scores over time according to mode of delivery or perineal injury.In this cohort 54% of women had a normal vaginal delivery, 21% had an instrumental delivery, and 25% gave birth by caesarean section. No difference was found in total FSFI or domain scores according to mode of delivery over time between antenatal assessment and 12 months postpartum. Pain was decreased in the caesarean group only at 6 months postpartum. All groups showed pain scores at 12 months that were comparable with antenatal levels. For those who gave birth vaginally, 27% had an intact perineum, 50% had an episiotomy, and 6%, 14%, and 3% had first, second, and third-degree tears, respectively. The only differences between groups were found over time according to perineal injury at 6 months in the arousal domain. At 12 months, total FSFI and domain scores were no different to initial scores.At 12 months postpartum sexual function has returned to early pregnancy levels, irrespective of mode of delivery or perineal injury.","delivery mode, episiotomy, perineal trauma, postpartum, sexual function"
"Experience with management of urinary bladder leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is rare. Therefore, to better elucidate the disease characteristics of urinary bladder LMS, we utilized a large population-based cancer registry to examine the epidemiology, natural history, pathological characteristics, prognostic factors, and treatment outcomes.The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (1973-2010) was used to identify cases by tumor site and histology codes. The association between clinical and demographic characteristics and long-term survival was examined.A total of 183 histologically confirmed cases were identified between 1973 and 2010. The annual age-adjusted incidence rate was 0.23 cases per 1,000,000 and did not significantly change over time. Median age of the patients was 65 years (interquartile range: 47-78 y). Of the patients with a known pathologic tumor stage (n = 164), 50% had a regional or distant disease. Overall, 63.2% of patients with known histologic grade (n = 106), had poorly differentiated or undifferentiated histology. Most patients (92.9%) received cancer-directed surgery (CDS), with 34.4% having radical or partial cystectomy. Only 7.7% of patients received radiation therapy in combination with surgery. The median disease-specific survival was 46 months. Five- and 10-year cancer-specific survival rates were 47%, and 35%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, a worse outcome was associated with an undifferentiated tumor grade, distant disease, and failure to undergo CDS.This series represents the largest cohort of LMS of the urinary bladder studied to date. LMS commonly presented as high grade and advanced stage with a poor prognosis. Reduced disease-specific survival was associated with increasing age, undifferentiated tumor grade, distant disease, and failure to undergo CDS.","cancer, leiomyosarcoma, outcomes, prognostic factors, seer, urinary bladder"
"Adenosine, 2-chloroadenosine and prostaglandin E1 which are known to increase cyclic AMP in neuroblastoma cells potentiated the acetylcholine-induced muscarinic hyperpolarization of the cells without changing the resting membrane potential. The potentiation caused by 2-chloroadenosine was further augmented by Ro 20-1724, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. A direct intracellular pressure application of cyclic AMP potentiated the muscarinic hyperpolarization without changing the resting membrane potential. Morphine which inhibits adenylate cyclase antagonized 2-chloroadenosine-induced potentiation of the muscarinic hyperpolarization. These results suggest that changes in cyclic AMP level modulate the muscarinic response of neuroblastoma cells.","neuroblastoma cells, prostaglandin e 1, adenosine, morphine, muscarinic hyperpolarization, cyclic amp"

"There are several techniques to detect the structural changes of proteins in solution. However it is difficult to apply them to the protein on solid phase. We show the possibility to monitor two kinds of signal changes for proteins immobilized on dextran resin by BIAcore biosensor based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Proteins with different properties were attached to sensor surfaces and various denatured states were induced by treatment with acidic or basic solutions. As a results, at least two different types of signal changes were detected real-time and these signal changes arose during and after the treatment with each solution that we denoted as in situ and post values, respectively. The in situ value seemed to have a strong correlation to the total charge state of the proteins which can be calculated theoretically, and the post value to the degree of structural changes of the proteins. This method is expected to be applied to various analyses and give us new information about the behavior of proteins on solid phase.","immobilized protein, protein denaturation, surface plasmon resonance, biacore, biosensor, structural change"
"In this paper a direct displacement-based design (DDBD) method for seismic design of steel frames equipped with dissipative braces is proposed. Attention is focused on concentric braced steel frames with pinned beam-to-column joints in which the bracing system (with viscoelastic or elastoplastic dissipative devices) is the main seismic resistant component. The proposed design method uses an equivalent continuous model where flexural deformability and shear deformability are related respectively to columns and diagonals of the bracing system. In this way, analytical expressions of the required flexural and shear stiffness distributions are obtained. These expressions are quite simple and can be conveniently used in preliminary design of dissipative diagonal braces and columns. Examples are shown for steel frames with dissipative braces based on elastomeric dampers (viscoelastic devices) and steel frames with buckling-restrained braces (elastoplastic devices). Results of time history analyses are illustrated and discussed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed DDBD procedure.","elastoplastic dampers, seismic design, buckling restrained braces, elastomeric dampers, viscoelastic dampers, displacement-based design, braced steel frames, shear deformation, design method"
"Based on the complementarity of face contour and facial region, the paper proposes a novel contour-region face detector. A new feature extraction method is proposed to efficiently depict face contour pattern. Both Face-Contour-Classifier and the Facial-Region-Classifier are trained as Support Vector Machine models. Bayesian decision rule is adopted to fusing both Face-Contour- and Facial-Region- classifiers. The proposed face detector is tested on a standard head image database, BioID gray color face image database and a color face database. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed contour-region face detector.","Bayes decision rule, Face detection, Information fusion, Support vector machine"
"It is hypothesized that the concurrent validity of questionnaires can be increased by the use of item weights obtained by expert scaling instead of using the conventional unit weights. Items from 11 scales of the High School Personality Quiz (HSPQ) were rewritten in a form permitting application of the constant sum method to the judgment of item weights. The scales were rated by 30 psychologists and ratio constructed for each factor scale. The HSPQ records of 43 delinquent girls were correlated with behavior ratings on 42 traits from Cattell's ""normal trait sphere"" as judged by the Ss' cottage parents. Validity coefficients are given for the HSPQ unit weight scores and for scores weighted by expert-derived ratio weights. Results show low magnitude increments in validity. Effects of scaling on the problem of agreement among questionnaire and rating data were also evaluated with similar results.

"Real-time embedded systems are often designed with different types of urgencies such as delayable or eager, that are modeled by several urgency variants of the timed automata model. However, most model checkers do not support such urgency semantics, except for the IF toolset that model checks timed automata with urgency against observers. This work proposes an Urgent Timed Automata (UTA) model with zone-based urgency semantics that gives the same model checking results as absolute urgency semantics of other existing urgency variants of the timed automata model, including timed automata with deadlines and timed automata with urgent transitions. A necessary and sufficient condition, called complete urgency, is formulated and proved for avoiding zone partitioning so that the system state graphs are simpler and model checking is faster. A novel zone capping method is proposed that is time-reactive, preserves complete urgency, satisfies all deadlines, and does not need zone partitioning. The proposed verification methods were implemented in the SGM CTL model checker and applied to real-time and embedded systems. Several experiments, comparing the state space sizes produced by SGM with that by the IF toolset, show that SGM produces much smaller state-spaces.","automata model, model check, model checking result, urgency, real-time embedded system, complete urgency, urgency semantics, model checker, model checking, existing urgency variant, sgm ctl model checker, absolute urgency semantics, formal verification, modeling, state space, satisfiability"
"A fundamental issue affecting the performance of a parallel application running on a heterogeneous computing system is the assignment of tasks to the processors in the system. The task assignment problem for more than three processors is known to be NP-hard, and therefore satisfactory suboptimal solutions obtainable in an acceptable amount of time are generally sought. This paper proposes a simple and effective iterative greedy algorithm to deal with the problem with goal of minimizing the total sum of execution and communication costs. The main idea in this algorithm is to improve the quality of the assignment in an iterative manner using results from previous iterations. The algorithm first uses a constructive heuristic to find an initial assignment and iteratively improves it in a greedy way. Through simulations over a wide range of parameters, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing it with recent competing task assignment algorithms in the literature.","meta-heuristics, iterative manner, fundamental issue, iterated greedy algorithm, task assignment, recent competing task assignment, acceptable amount, constructive heuristic, effective iterative greedy algorithm, communication cost, heterogeneous computing, heterogeneous computing system, task interaction graph, task assignment problem, initial assignment, effective iterated greedy algorithm, greedy algorithm, meta heuristics"
"The concept of delight is of great interest to practitioners who understand that to keep customers loyal, a firm must go beyond merely satisfying to truly delighting them [Bus. Mark. Dig. 17 (1992) 17; Mark. News 24 (1990) 10]. However, few studies specifically dedicated to customer delight have surfaced in the marketing literature [J. Retail. 73 (1997) 311], and no research to the authors' knowledge has explored delight in a retail setting. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine customer delight in a retail-shopping context. Specifically, qualitative research was conducted to determine the sources of delightful and terrible shopping experiences for retail shoppers. Critical incident analysis of 113 depth interviews with shoppers revealed several factors associated with delightful or terrible shopping experiences and the resulting consequences from these experiences. A number of strategic implications are discussed, and limitations and directions for future research are also addressed.","shopping, critical incident technique, customer delight, satisfiability, qualitative research"
"Prior research on the impact of organizational memory on new product success has divergent perspectives. Such inconsistency has accrued mainly from not considering memory's multifaceted aspects, which interact with specific project characteristics. This paper tries to sort out this paradox by proposing that project innovativeness moderates the relationship among variables of organizational memory and new product success. An empirical study of 169 NPD projects of Korean manufacturing firms finds that memory sharing and the use of external information and formal procedures enhance new product success, whereas organizational memory has no effect. Project innovativeness is found to moderate memory's effect, despite some tradeoffs. As innovativeness increases, the effect of organizational memory and use of external information become stronger whereas the effect of memory sharing and use of formal procedures weaken. This suggests that firms must activate organizational memory more carefully according to project characteristics and the memory level to maximize its positive effects.","formal procedures, memory sharing, organizational memory, new product success, project innovativeness, external information, empirical study"
"Studies have been made of the bone marrow in 9 newborn infants and in 8 infants 1 week old, at the altitudes of 4,540 meters (14,900 fect) and 3,730 meters (12,240 feet). A comparative study has been made with previous observations, of a similar nature, carried out by us at sea level. Hyperplasia of the erythroid cells was found but the degree was no greater than the one observed at sea level. No changes were evident in the myeloid and megakaryocytic cell series. An inhibition of the erythropoieticactivity was found one week after birth. This process was moderately more accentuated at sea level than at high altitudes.","altitude/effects, bone marrow/physiology, infant, newborn/physiology, high altitude"
"Research within the United States on seismic engineering of buildings using composite steel/concrete structural systems has increased dramatically in the past decade. This paper summarizes recent research on a number of these composite lateral resistance systems, including unbraced moment frames consisting of steel girders with concrete-filled steel tube (CFT) or steel reinforced concrete (SRC) columns; braced frames having concrete-filled steel tube columns; and a variety of composite and hybrid wall systems. The benefits of these structural systems relative to more common systems include their performance characteristics when subjected to service or ultimate loads, and their economy with respect both to material and construction. In addition, more in-depth research results will be presented on one of these composite systems, consisting of partially-restrained steel frames with composite reinforced concrete infill walls. The paper concludes with a summary of probable future design provisions for these composite systems.","Composite construction, HWS, Hybrid wall system, Steel reinforced concrete, Composite wall system, Beam-column, Beam-to-column connection, Seismic engineering, Concrete-filled steel tube, CFT, SRC"
"Grooming may be defined as the frequent and gentle cleaning of a ship hull coating, when it is in port or idle, to prevent the establishment of fouling. This study assessed the effectiveness of grooming with a five-headed rotating brush system on epoxy, ablative copper and two silicone fouling release (FR) coatings. These coatings were placed under static immersion at Port Canaveral, FL on a weekly and biweekly frequency. The results showed that grooming reduced fouling on all surfaces and was able to prevent fouling on the ablative copper and FR coatings when performed weekly. It was concluded that the grooming tool used for these tests was sufficient to remove biofilm and most hard fouling. However, when fouling pressure increased or when grooming was performed less frequently, insufficient forces were imparted by the brush to remove all of the established hard fouling organisms.","adhesion, brush, fouling, grooming, shear stress, ship hull"

"The paper reports on the research activities the authors recently started with the aim of improving energy management in Telecom switching plants. Main objective of the research is to minimize the energy consumption associated to room climate control (CC). Specifically in this work, a model of room thermal dynamics was developed. In order to achieve a satisfactory compromise between accuracy, experimental burden and computational time, a grey-box approach was adopted. A lumped capacity description of a selected telecommunication (TLC) equipment room was performed, by applying the first principle of Thermodynamics to a control volume including: walls; TLC equipment; air filling the room; CC system, which mainly consists of free-coolers (FC) and refrigeration units (RU). Therefore, room temperature variation is estimated as function of heat released by TLC equipment, air moved by free-coolers, cold air supplied by the refrigeration units and heat exchange with the surroundings. Model generalization, performed comparing simulations with real measurements, highlighted the very good accuracy guaranteed by the modeling methodology proposed in the paper. Moreover, the relative simplicity and limited number of unknown parameters suggest using the model in optimization analyses aimed at minimizing CC-related energy consumption for a variety of TLC switching plants. Preliminary model-based scenario analyses were carried-out, showing that improved CC system management may result in energy savings as high as 25%.","energetic efficiency, climate control, telecommunication equipment, lumped capacity modeling, optimization, first principle, thermodynamics, energy management, heat exchanger, system management, room temperature"
"Previous work in adults and youths has suggested that juvenile onset bipolar disorder (BPD) is associated with an elevated risk of substance use disorders (SUD). Considering the public health importance of this issue, the authors now report on a controlled study of adolescents with and without BPD to evaluate the risk of SUD.Probands with DSM-IV BPD (n=57, mean age +/- SD=13.3 +/- 2.4 years) and without DSM-IV BPD (n=46, 13.6 +/- 2.2 years) were studied. Structured psychiatric interviews and multiple measures of SUD were collected.Bipolar disorder was associated with a highly significant risk factor for SUD (32% versus 7%, Z=2.9, p=.004) that was not accounted for by conduct disorder (adjusted odds ratio=5.4, p=.018). Adolescent-onset BPD (> or =13 years) was associated with a higher risk of SUD compared with those with child-onset BPD (chi1=9.3, p=.002).These findings strongly indicate that BPD, especially adolescent onset, is a significant risk factor for SUD independently of conduct disorder.","substance use disorder, risk, substance abuse, psychiatry, public health"
"<p>Disinfection contactors are frequently characterized using tracer studies to determine macromixing patterns. For some applications, such as compliance with the surface water treatment rule, this information can be interpreted directly without much analysis. However, when tracer studies are performed to characterize residence time distributions for design purposes, this information is frequently analyzed using a method of moments approach. This paper shows that the method of moments approach, when compared to a nonlinear regression approach, produces a biased estimate of mean residence time and dimensionless variance, and one with a greater mean square error. The amount of bias in moments estimators is significant in a numerical sense, and leads to qualitatively poor estimation of the resulting residence time distribution. Examples are given of characterization of a pilot-scale chlorine contactor and a pilot-scale ozone contactor.</p>","chlorine, water treatment, distribution functions, residence time distribution"
"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) binding sites in rat cardiac ventricular membranes have been characterized in detail. 125I-NPY bound to the membranes with high affinity. Binding was saturable, reversible and specific, and depended on time, pH and temperature. Analysis of the binding data obtained under optimal conditions, 2 hr, 18 degrees C and at pH 7.5, revealed the presence of low and high affinity binding sites. The high affinity binding sites had an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.38 nM and a binding capacity (Bmax) of 7.13 fmol/mg protein. The apparent Kd and Bmax for low affinity binding sites were 22.34 nM and 261.25 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Peptides unrelated to NPY did not compete with 125I-NPY for the binding sites even at 1 microM concentrations, whereas homologous peptides, peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP), and NPY(13-36) inhibited 125I-NPY binding but with lower potency compared to NPY. 125I-NPY binding was sensitive to the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, Gpp(NH)p, suggesting that the NPY receptor is coupled to the adenylate cyclase system. The ventricular membrane receptor characterized in this study may play an important role in mediating the physiological effects of NPY in the heart.","neuropeptide y, binding site, dissociation constant, receptor, membrane protein, nervous system, kinetics, chemical composition, reaction kinetics, beta decay"
"A transposon tagging system, based upon maize Ac/Ds elements, was developed in barley (Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare). The long-term objective of this project is to identify a set of lines with Ds insertions dispersed throughout the genome as a comprehensive tool for gene discovery and reverse genetics. AcTPase and Ds-bar elements were introduced into immature embryos of Golden Promise by biolistic transformation. Subsequent transposition and segregation of Ds away from AcTPase and the original site of integration resulted in new lines, each containing a stabilized Ds element in a new location. The sequence of the genomic DNA flanking the Ds elements was obtained by inverse PCR and TAIL-PCR. Using a sequence-based mapping strategy, we determined the genome locations of the Ds insertions in 19 independent lines using primarily restriction digest-based assays of PCR-amplified single nucleotide polymorphisms and PCR-based assays of insertions or deletions.The proncipal strategy was to identify and map sequence polymorphisms in the regions corresponding to the flanking DNA using the Oregon Wolfe Barley mapping population. The mapping results obtained by the sequence-based approach were confirmed by RFLP analyses in four of the lines. In addition, cloned DNA sequences corresponding to the flanking DNA were used to assign map locations to Morex-derived genomic BAC library inserts, thus integrating genetic and physical maps of barley. BLAST search results indicate that the majority of the transposed Ds elements are found within predicted or known coding sequences. Transposon tagging in barley using Ac/Ds thus promises to provide a useful tool for studies on the functional genomics of the Triticeae.","Transposon tagging, Barley, Reverse genetics, Ac/Ds, Mapping"
"Finding ways and means to incorporate emotional experience into consumer and market research has been an ongoing challenge. We frame this challenge in the context of the information that is and is not normally collected in multiattribute attitude models. Our data show that retrospective reports about emotional experiences can be useful predictors of attitude when compared to traditional measures of cognitive structure, and that prior experience with a behavior can play a major role in moderating these relationships. The appeal of multiattribute attitude models has always been their value for predicting and diagnosing motives and preferences. Integrating emotive information into these models appears to be a way to build on this appeal.","consumer, emotion, attitude, market research"
"In the majority of structural applications, single angles are usually loaded in such a manner that the applied load is eccentric. Eccentrically loaded single-angle struts are among the most difficult structural members to analyse and design. In many cases, the compressive resistances calculated using existing conventional design models can differ greatly from experimental results available in the literature. In this study, the potential of using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict the load-carrying capacity of pin-ended single-angle struts is investigated. Results of reported experimental studies on eccentrically loaded steel single-angle struts were used to train and validate the proposed ANN model. The performance of the proposed ANN model was subsequently compared to that of the AISC specification currently in use. It is shown that neural networks outperform the current AISC specification and provide an efficient alternative method in predicting the load-carrying capacity of eccentrically loaded single-angle struts. Using the developed ANN model, a parametric study was then conducted on angles connected by one leg to investigate the effect of changing the location of the applied load.","steel structures, compressive resistance, angles, neural networks, eccentric loading, structural steel design, carrying capacity, neural network, artificial neural network, neural network model"
"To test developmental paths from adolescent syndromes and other candidate predictors to young adult syndromes.A national sample assessed at ages 13 through 16 and 16 through 19 years was reassessed at 19 through 22 years in terms of six syndromes derived empirically from parent and self-reports, two syndromes derived only from parent reports, and one derived from self-reports.Several young adult syndromes were similar to adolescent syndromes and were strongly predicted by these syndromes. A new syndrome designated as Shows Off and an adult Aggressive Behavior syndrome were both predicted by the adolescent Aggressive Behavior syndrome. This indicates a developmental transition away from overt aggression among some aggressive youths but not others. A syndrome designated as Irresponsible was predicted by the adolescent Attention Problems syndrome and may be an adult phenotype of attention deficit disorder. Surprisingly, attention problems were associated with more diverse problems among females than males.There are strong predictive relations from adolescent to adult syndromes. Sex differences in predictive paths argue against basing assumptions about both sexes on findings for one sex.","young adult self-report, child behavior checklist, young adult syndromes, young adult behavior checklist, developmental psychopathology, young adult"
The electrical properties in graphite nanosheet (GN) filled polymer blends which are immiscible with each other were studied as a function of the polymer's blend ratio. The electrical conductivity of polymer blends is found to be determined by two factors: the double percolation effect and the crystalline change of the polymer blends. The SEM micrographs show that GN preferientially distributed unevenly in high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The selective localization of GN in polyblend is also closely related to the crystalline change of polymer blend. The degree of crystallinity of composite is different at different polymer's blend ratio and thereby influences the localization of GN in the polyblend. The piezoresistive behavior of immiscible conductive blends was investigated to gain better understanding of relationship between morphology and electrical conductivity.,"electrical property, blends, nanocomposites, graphite nanosheet, conducting polymers, polymer blend, high density polyethylene, electric conductivity, conducting polymer"
"Creation of a new generation of structures capable of continuous real-time monitoring of their own structural behavior will be a major advancement in structural engineering. The research presented herein lays the groundwork for monitoring the behavior of steel structures using distributed optical fiber sensors. The properties of light traveling through an optical fiber can be affected by very small changes in fiber geometry caused by conditions such as elongation, bending, or twisting. These are also conditions that are encountered in steel structures. To demonstrate the viability of using surface-mounted fiber optic sensors to monitor the behavior of steel structures, an experimental research program was carried out on a sample steel structure. The sample structure consisted of a simply supported W-shape test beam and an optomechanical system for monitoring the structural behavior of the test beam. The optomechanical system consisted of five primary components: a light emitter and circuitry, optical fiber, a light detector and circuitry, an analyzer, and bypass circuitry. The indirectly measured loading on the test beam (as determined by the optomechanical system) compared well with the directly measured loading.","optical fibers, steel structures, sensors, laser, smart structures, real-time monitoring, optical fiber, optical fiber sensor, structural engineering, fiber optic sensor"
"In line with recent studies distinguishing between symptom and personality trait complexes a questionnaire purporting to measure the hysteroid/obsessoid dimension of personality was devised. The questionnaire was administered to 93 neurotic patients in a mental hospital who were rated by the staff on the relevant personality traits. An analysis of the ratings was carried out and the questionnaire was related to the rating scale classification and to other clinical and psychological test material as available. The questionnaire was found to relate to personality measures more closely than to symptom measures with a correlation of .68 with the rating classification significant at the .001 level. Arguments were advanced as to why the questionnaire should be regarded as primarily a measure of the hysteroid/obsessoid dimension. (16 ref.)

"This study compared the effects of the colour and size of overlays on reading time, reading errors and on the clarity of text with young primary school children. The sample comprised a non-clinical, typical, sample from an East London primary school. One hundred and six children aged between four and seven years were asked to read 11 short passages of text (60 words) either with full page overlays or smaller reading rulers (53 in each group). This sample included younger children than has often been tested before. The 11 short passages allowed an assessment of baseline reading performance (no reading aid) and performance while reading with each of a set of ten coloured reading aids. Two different, yet beneficial, colours were determined: the most effective and the clearest/most comfortable. Both of these measures are not usually recorded. All but four children had reduced reading times with one of the reading aids and all but one reported their aid improved the perceived visual clarity of the text: the size of the reading aid did not affect reading time or visual clarity significantly. The numbers of skipped words and errors/mis-read words also decreased when reading with the most effective and most comfortable reading aid. Near visual acuity was assessed with and without each child's most effective coloured aid. The most effective aid improved acuity in over a third of the children. Acuity has not been assessed in previous studies. As reported previously, different colours helped different children. In conclusion, coloured reading overlays reduced reading times on the reading test employed here and the size of the reading aid was not crucial to facilitate performance. The largest reductions occurred for the youngest readers, suggesting these aids may be particularly effective for early readers.","Coloured overlays, Coloured reading rulers, Primary school children, Reading, Visual clarity, Visual stress"
"In this paper, we discuss how profiles of communicative behaviour can be used to present and analyse information about role activity recorded through structured observation of specific situations. The role activities are encoded as distinctive speech acts. Example profiles resulting from the analysis of three clinicians' communicative behaviour during pre-rounds meetings and ward rounds are given. The examples are based on an observational study performed at a Norwegian university hospital. One fifth-year medical student spent 20 days in two different hospital wards, following 7 physicians from one to seven days each. The observer recorded data from several ward situations such as pre-rounds meetings, ward rounds, and discharge situations. The data was recorded by means of an observation form consisting of a mixture of codes and free-text fields. The data has been post-processed by associating each event with one communicative act. The approach is an efficient and useful means for studying clinicians' information and communication patterns in hospital wards, which can serve as an important tool in the design of new clinical information systems.","requirements elicitation, communicative acts profiling, software design, point of care clinical information systems, . structured observation, structured observation"
"We present a systematic, practical approach to developing risk prediction systems, suitable for use with large databases of medical information. An important part of this approach is a novel feature selection algorithm which uses the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to measure the expected discriminative power of different sets of predictor variables. We describe this algorithm and use it to select variables to predict risk of a specific adverse pregnancy outcome: failure to progress in labour. Neural network, logistic regression and hierarchical Bayesian risk prediction models are constructed, all of which achieve close to the limit of performance attainable on this prediction task. We show that better prediction performance requires more discriminative clinical information rather than improved modelling techniques. It is also shown that better diagnostic criteria in clinical records would greatly assist the development of systems to predict risk in pregnancy.","receiver operating characteristic (roc), feature selection, neural networks, risk prediction in pregnancy, failure to progress, risk, algorithm, bayes theorem, regression analysis, risk assessment, obstetrics, roc curve, artificial neural network, data base, algorithms, mathematical models, receiver operating characteristic, prediction"
"Consider a system composed of mobile robots that move on the plane, each of which independently executing its own instance of an algorithm. Given a desired geometric pattern, the flocking problem consists in ensuring that the robots form this pattern and maintain it while moving together on the plane. In this paper, we explore flocking in the presence of faulty robots, where the desired pattern is a regular polygon. We propose a distributed fault tolerant flocking algorithm assuming a semi-synchronous model with a k-bounded scheduler, in the sense that no robot is activated no more than k times between any two consecutive activations of any other robot. The algorithm is composed of three parts: failure detector, ranking assignment, and flocking algorithm. The role of the rank assignment is to provide a persistent and unique ranking for the robots. The failure detector identifies the set of currently correct robots in the system. Finally, the flocking algorithm handles the movement and reconfiguration of the flock, while maintaining the desired shape. The difficulty of the problem comes from the combination of the three parts, together with the necessity to prevent collisions and allow the rotation of the flock. We formally prove the correctness of our proposed solution.","distributed algorithms, ranking assignment, failure detector, faulty robot, k -bounded scheduler, mobile robots, flocking, rank assignment, geometric pattern, consecutive activation, mobile robot, fault tolerance, fault tolerant, autonomous mobile robot, correct robot, unique ranking, distributed algorithm"
"Triclosan (5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol) is a potent antibacterial and antifungal compound that is widely used in personal care products, plastics, and fabrics. Recently triclosan has been shown to alter endocrine function in a variety of species. The purpose of this study was to determine effects of triclosan on pubertal development and thyroid hormone concentrations in the male rat. Weanling rats were exposed to 0, 3, 30, 100, 200, or 300 mg/kg of triclosan by oral gavage from postnatal day (PND) 23 to 53. Preputial separation (PPS) was examined beginning on PND 33. Rats were killed on PND 53, organ weights were recorded and serum was collected for subsequent analysis. Triclosan did not affect growth or the onset of PPS. Serum testosterone was significantly decreased at 200 mg/kg, however no effects were observed on androgen-dependent reproductive tissue weights. Triclosan significantly decreased total serum thyroxine (T4) in a dose-dependent manner at 30 mg/kg and higher (no observed effect level of 3 mg/kg). Triiodothyronine (T3) was significantly decreased only at 200 mg/kg, but thyroid stimulating hormone was not statistically different at any dose. Liver weights were significantly increased at 100 mg/kg triclosan and above suggesting that the induction of hepatic enzymes may have contributed to the altered T4 and T3 concentrations, but it does not appear to correlate with the T4 dose-response. This study demonstrates that triclosan exposure does not alter androgen-dependent tissue weights or onset of PPS; however, triclosan exposure significantly impacts thyroid hormone concentrations in the male juvenile rat.","thyroid hormone., triclosan, puberty, testosterone, toxicology, sexual maturity, toxicity, dose response, enzyme"
"This paper investigates the capacity limit of an uplink waveform channel assuming imperfect channel state information at the receiver (CSIR). Various realistic assumptions are incorporated into the problem, which make the study valuable for performance assessment of real cellular networks to identify potentials for performance improvements in practical receiver designs. We assume that the continuous-time received signal is first discretized by mismatched filtering based on the imperfect CSIR. The resulting discrete-time signals are then decoded considering two different decoding strategies, i.e., an optimal decoding strategy based on specific statistics of channel estimation errors and a sub-optimal decoding strategy treating the estimation error signal as additive Gaussian noise. Motivated by the proposed decoding strategies, we study the performance of the decision feedback equalizer for finite constellation inputs, in which inter-stream interferences are treated either using their true statistics or as Gaussian noise. Numerical results are provided to exemplify the benefit of exploiting the knowledge on the statistics of the channel estimation errors and inter-stream interferences. Simulations also assess the effect of the CSI imperfectness on the achievable rate, which reveal that finite constellation inputs are less sensitive to the estimation accuracy than Gaussian input, especially in the high SNR regime.","Receivers, Channel estimation, Decoding, Estimation error, Uplink, Decision feedback equalizers, Channel capacity"
"BACKGROUND: Being born in winter and spring is considered one of the most robust epidemiological risk factors for schizophrenia. The aetiology and exact timing of this birth excess, however, has remained elusive so far. Since during phylogeny, Borrelia DNA has led to multiple germ-line mutations within the CB1 candidate gene for schizophrenia, a meta analysis has been performed of all papers on schizophrenic birth excesses with no less than 3000 cases each. All published numerical data were then plotted against the seasonal distributions of Ixodes ticks worldwide. RESULTS: In the United States, Europe and Japan the birth excesses of those individuals who later in life develop schizophrenia mirror the seasonal distribution of Ixodes ticks nine months earlier at the time of conception. South of the Wallace Line, which limits the spread of Ixodes ticks and Borrelia burgdorferi into Australia, seasonal trends are less significant, and in Singapore, being non-endemic for Ixodes ticks and Lyme disease, schizophrenic birth excesses are absent. CONCLUSION: At present, it cannot be excluded that prenatal infection by B. burgdorferi is harmful to the implanting human blastocyst. The epidemiological clustering of sporadic schizophrenia by season and locality rather emphasises the risk to the unborn of developing a congenital, yet preventable brain disorder later in life.","Schizophrenia, Lyme Disease, Borrelia Burgdorferi, Adult Tick, Tick Activity"
"The goal of the American Association for Applied Psychology is unified professional status in service to the public. It is fortunate that it can have varied direction in the procedures of certification in view of the many practical requirements for specialized psychological work which are indicated in the contribution by Dr. Selling in this issue. Much has been said about coordinating general psychological training and professional specialization. In his presidential address before the A.A.A.P. in 1940, Dr. English noted the failure of psychology departments in our universities to keep abreast of the present professional needs for training. Some may consider that a reorientation of professional training should have priority over certification. Others may view this as impractical. This number of the JOURNAL discusses the problems of certification from many angles.

"Although the benefits of semi-rigid connections and composite actions of slabs are extensively documented in the design of steel frames, they are not widely used in practice. The primary cause is the lack of appropriate practical design methods. In this paper, a practical method suitable for the design of semi-rigid composite frames under vertical loads is proposed. The proposed method provides the design of the connections, beams and columns for semi-rigid composite frames at the ultimate and serviceability limit states. The rotational stiffness of beam-to-column connections for calculating the deflection of the frame beams and the effective length factor of columns are also determined. In addition, the accuracy of the proposed design method is verified by a pair of tests carried out on full-scale semi-rigid composite frames. Moreover, a design example is proposed to demonstrate the application of the proposed design method. It is shown that the proposed design method not only takes into account the actual behavior of the beam-to-column connections and its influence on the behavior of the overall structures, but is also simple and convenient for a designer to use in engineering practice.","Design method, Composite action of slab, Vertical load, Semi-rigid connection, Rotational stiffness, Composite frame"
"The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of tadalafil (TDF) on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rat ovaries.Thirty-five female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 7): sham (S), I/R1, I/R2, TDF1, and TDF2. In the I/R1 and TDF1 groups, 3-hour ischemia was followed by 12-hour reperfusion; and in the I/R2 and TDF2 groups, 3-hour ischemia was followed by 24-hour reperfusion. In the TDF groups, 30 minutes before reperfusion, a single dose of 5 mg/kg TDF was administered intraperitoneally. The ovarian tissue levels of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide (NO), and the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase were measured biochemically. Tissue damage to ovarian tissue was scored by histopathologic examination.The tissue malondialdehyde levels were significantly higher and the catalase and superoxide dismutase activities were significantly lower in the I/R groups compared with the S and TDF groups (P < .05). The NO levels were significantly higher in the TDF1 group than the S and I/R1 groups (P < .05). Although the NO levels were increased in the TDF2 group compared with the I/R2 group, the difference was not significant. Ovarian tissue damage scores of the I/R groups were significantly higher than those of the S group (P < .05). Treatment with TDF significantly decreased the ovarian tissue damage scores in the TDF groups compared with the I/R groups (P < .05).Tadalafil is effective in preventing tissue damage induced by I/R in rat ovaries.","rat, ovary, tadalafil, ischemia-reperfusion"
"To identify clinical profiles discriminating depressed adolescents on the basis of comorbid alcohol/substance use disorders and to determine whether or not profiles with high predictive power are gender-specific.One hundred three adolescent inpatients with major depression (65 girls, 38 boys) participated in a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. Independent assessments of depression, suicidality, and psychosocial adjustment were conducted using well-validated instruments.Gender-specific clinical profiles were identified that predicted alcohol/substance abuse in depressed adolescents with high levels of sensitivity (90%). The significant discriminant function for depressed girls included the following predictors: longer depressive episodes, more conduct problems and psychosocial impairment, and more active involvement in relationships with boys. The significant discriminant function for depressed boys included conduct disorder, older age, and schoolwork problems. These profiles correctly identified most depressed adolescents with comorbid alcohol/substance abuse.Given that alcohol abuse and depression are associated with highly impaired social functioning and increased risk of self-harm, sensitivity in case identification is critical. Clinicians should conduct comprehensive assessments of alcohol/substance abuse in depressed adolescents with the identified clinical profiles.","alcohol abuse, suicide risk, adolescents, depression, ergonomics, human factors, occupational safety, injury prevention, substance abuse, substance use disorder, suicide prevention"
"There are three major problems with software projects: over budget, behind schedule, and poor quality. It is often too late to correct these problems by the time they are detected in failed software projects. In this paper, we discuss design, implementation, and evaluation of an experimental intelligent software early warning system based on fuzzy logic using an integrated set of software metrics. It consists of the following components: software metrics database, risk knowledge base, intelligent risk assessment, and risk tracing. It helps to assess risks associated with the three problems from perspectives of product, process, and organization in the early phases of the software development process. It is capable of aggregating various partial risk assessment results into an overall risk indicator even if they may be conflicting. In addition, it can be used to analyze a risk by identifying its root causes through its risk tracing utility.","solid software model, fuzzy set, software riskassessment, software metrics, early warning, software development, project management, intelligent software, process improvement, quality management, fuzzy inference rule, fuzzy logic, software quality improvement, metrics, unfruitful software development project, fuzzy linguistic variable, intelligent early warning system, risk assessment, software maintenance, risk management, early warning system, software quality, software metric"
"As the cost of programming becomes a major component of the cost of computer systems, it becomes imperative that program development and maintenance be better managed. One measurement a manager could use is programming complexity. Such a measure can be very useful if the manager is confident that the higher the complexity measure is for a programming project, the more effort it takes to complete the project and perhaps to maintain it. Until recently most measures of complexity were based only on intuition and experience. In the past 3 years two objective metrics have been introduced, McCabe's cyclomatic number v(G) and Halstead's effort measure E. This paper reports an empirical study designed to compare these two metrics with a classic size measure, lines of code. A fourth metric based on a model of programming is introduced and shown to be better than the previously known metrics for some experimental data.","complexity measure, computer system, objective metrics, programming complexity, classic size measure, programming effort, experimental data, programming project, empirical study, cyclomatic number v, effort measure e."
"This study evaluates the capital-structure determinants of Latin American firms using a comprehensive sample covering seven countries. Firms in the region have debt levels similar to those of U.S. firms, which is puzzling, given that Latin American firms experience relatively lower tax benefits and higher bankruptcy costs. This study argues that ownership-concentrated firms avoid issuing equity because they do not want to share control rights. Latin American firms have high ownership concentration, which creates an ideal setting to study how ownership concentration explains firms' capital structure. Consistent with the control argument, this study finds a positive relation between leverage and ownership concentration, when losing control becomes an issue. Also, the study shows a positive relation between leverage and growth. In addition, the study reports that other determinants that do not proxy for control rights are consistent with previous findings. Firms that are larger, have more tangible assets, and are less profitable are also more leveraged.","ownership control, capital structure, latin america, emerging markets, emerging market, latin american, profitability"
"The survival of a transplanted organ is dependent on maintenance of continuous immunosuppression. However, even the strictest adherence to the recommended drug levels does not prevent the occurrence of numerous complications associated with immunosuppression. The efficacy of immunosuppression therapy protocols would be enhanced greatly by the availability of biotechnologies capable of identifying and predicting immunological events prior to the manifestation of clinical parameters indicating graft failure. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential contribution of some modern tools for post-transplantation monitoring, and to propose a method for combining them into a comprehensive mechanism for this purpose. The technologies utilized in this study are among a group of 'cutting edge' diagnostic methods at the initial steps of evaluation for their potential contribution for post-transplantation immune monitoring. This study was a pioneering opportunity to combine and utilize these tools jointly. The method of research was based on monitoring 13 adult kidney transplant recipients. The Immuknow assay determined cellular immunity status by quantitative measurement of intracellular ATP level in CD4(+) lymphocytes after PHA stimulation. Sera were analyzed for concentration of soluble CD30 reflecting primary allo-stimulation and for donor specific anti-HLA antibodies responsible for accelerated and refractory rejection. The results were correlated with clinical and pathological parameters and appraisal of predictive value was attempted. In Immuknow assay analysis ATP incremental changes indicative of rejection or infection were found in 75% and in 50% incidences, respectively. In stable patients, the ATP deviation from the preoperative baseline, indicative of stable engraftment, was much less pronounced than in other habitual clinical tests. CD30 concentrations were measured greatly above normal values prior to biopsy-proven rejection episodes, both before and after the transplant operation. Anti-HLA antibodies were elevated at a later stage, concurrently with clinical manifestation of graft failure and rejection. Anti-HLA antibody level remained negligible in patients going through a stable post-transplant clinical course. Overall, the utilization of the platform of combined biotechnologies could serve as a valuable tool for immune monitoring in organ transplantation, allowing for therapeutic intervention that can favorably affect the clinical outcome.","post-transplant, immune monitoring, monitoring, organ transplantation"
"The role of CD40 ligand (CD40L) in the primary activation of T cells is not clear. The cellular and humoral immune responses to adenoviral vectors in a murine model of liver-directed gene transfer were studied to define the mechanisms responsible for CD40L-dependent T cell priming. CD40L-deficient mice did not develop effective cytotoxic T cells to transduced hepatocytes, and T cell-dependent B cell responses were absent. Full reconstitution of cellular and humoral immunity was achieved in CD40L-deficient mice by administration of an activating antibody to CD40 that increased expression of B7.2 on spleen cells. Wild-type mice could be made nonresponsive to vector by administration of antibodies to B7. Thus, CD40L-dependent activation of T cells occurs through signaling of CD40 in the antigen-presenting cell to enhance requisite costimulatory pathways that include B7.","gene transfer, adenoviral vector, cytotoxic t cells, antigen presenting cell"

The authors analyze the way companies deal with market intelligence to facilitate the identification of customer needs and to generate the appropriate response to such needs. Research methodology includes multiple case studies of retail companies with e-business operations (the three largest in Brazil). The findings indicate that investment in interorganizational systems strongly supports the development of MO capabilities.

"Hansen and Singleton (1982) and Dunn and Singleton (1986) have found supporting evidence for the overidentifying restrictions of two empirical consumption-based asset pricing models, when estimated with a particular set of single asset returns. In this paper, we submit these models to further scrutiny by testing whether they exhibit (structural) stability. A series of tests, recently developed by Ghysels and Hall (1990), are applied and a test for structuralinvariance is introduced based on the likelihood ratio type test procedure of Eichenbaum, Hansen, and Singleton (1988). There are a number of reasons why structural stability tests are particularly appropriate for diagnostic testing of Euler equation models, namely: (1) the Lucas econometric policy evaluation critique; (2) Euler equations are only a partial description of the data-generating process and parameter stability is one of the few assumptions imposed in their estimation via the generalized method of moments; and finally (3) it is demonstrated that Hansen's overidentifying restrictions test has no power against a class of local alternatives characterized by a parameter drift.","euler equation, diagnosis, test statistic, capital asset pricing model, empirical model, econometrics, likelihood ratio, finance, stability"

"Accidents happen and unfortunately people may loose part of their body members. Studies have shown that in this case, most individuals suffer physically and psychologically. For this reason, actions to restore the patient's freedom and mobility are imperative. Traditional solutions require ways to adapt the individual to prosthetic devices. This idea is also applied to patients who have congenital limitations. However, one of the major difficulties faced by those who are fitted with these devices is the great mental effort needed during first stages of training. As a result, a meaningful number of patients give up the use of theses devices very soon. Thus, this article reports on a solution designed by the authors to help patients during the learning phases, without actually having to wear the prosthesis. This solution considers Virtual (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) techniques to mimic the prosthesis natural counterparts. Thus, it is expected that problems such as weight, heat and pain should not contribute to an already hard task.","real time systems, virtual reality, solid modeling, augmented reality"
"This paper describes a program design discipline that has successfully produced well-modularized programs. The basic approach is to apply, in a uniform way, the concepts of data and procedural abstraction in a top-down decomposition during the initial programming-in-the-large phase of construction. This combination of data and procedural abstraction, called hybrid abstraction, views the system as composed almost entirely of abstract objects. The resulting structural design is partially expressed as a syntactic specification for a set of modules (a module being a set of objects) having no directly shared global data. In addition to the syntactic specification, the design expresses the abstract type decomposition and the structural relationships of the modules. Three relations on the set of modules define the hierarchies is called by, implements, and obtains resources from. These relations define the discipline and characterize the class of designs possible. Modules in practice are used in two different ways: single-instance use and multiple-instance use. Abstract objects can be of two different kinds: collection objects and singular objects. The relationships of these variations in module construction are illustrated. Three moderately large examples are shown. euclid is used to illustrate the discipline.","different way, abstraction hierarchy, abstract type decomposition, top-down design, abstract object, syntactic specification, different kind, structural design, hybrid abstraction, global data, procedural abstraction, program design discipline, top down"
"To this day, the slit lamp remains the first tool used by an ophthalmologist to examine patient eyes. Imaging of the retina poses, however, a variety of problems, namely a shallow depth of focus, reflections from the optical system, a small field of view and non-uniform illumination. For ophthalmologists, the use of slit lamp images for documentation and analysis purposes, however, remains extremely challenging due to large image artifacts. For this reason, we propose an automatic retinal slit lamp video mosaicking, which enlarges the field of view and reduces amount of noise and reflections, thus enhancing image quality.Our method is composed of three parts: (i) viable content segmentation, (ii) global registration and (iii) image blending. Frame content is segmented using gradient boosting with custom pixel-wise features. Speeded-up robust features are used for finding pair-wise translations between frames with robust random sample consensus estimation and graph-based simultaneous localization and mapping for global bundle adjustment. Foreground-aware blending based on feathering merges video frames into comprehensive mosaics.Foreground is segmented successfully with an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9557. Mosaicking results and state-of-the-art methods were compared and rated by ophthalmologists showing a strong preference for a large field of view provided by our method.The proposed method for global registration of retinal slit lamp images of the retina into comprehensive mosaics improves over state-of-the-art methods and is preferred qualitatively.","Blending, Mosaicking, Slit lamp, Tracking"
"This study examines age differences in memory for radio advertisements. Younger and older adults listened to a bogus radio program. Half of each age category listened to a version of the program embedded with two ads utilizing a simple rhyming mnemonic device. The other half of each age category listened to the same program, but with ads without any rhyming mnemonics. Various measures of recall and recognition of the target ads were taken both immediately after exposure and after a 7-day delay. While no age differences in memory emerged, mnemonic versions of the ads resulted in better scores for overall unaided memory, prompted brand recall, and overall memory for both age groups. There were no differences in memory scores over the 7-day delay, nor were there any interaction effects.","memory, radio advertisements, mnemonics, age differences, age groups, interaction effect"
"Phosphoinositides (PIs) have long been known to have an essential role in cell physiology. Their intracellular localization and concentration must be tightly regulated for their proper function. This spatial and temporal regulation is achieved by a large number of PI kinases and phosphatases that are present throughout eukaryotic species. One family of these enzymes contains a conserved PI phosphatase domain termed Sac. Although the Sac domain is homologous among different Sac domain-containing proteins, all appear to exhibit varied substrate specificity and subcellular localization. Dysfunctions in several members of this family are implicated in a range of human diseases such as cardiac hypertrophy, bipolar disorder, Down's syndrome, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In plant, several Sac domain-containing proteins have been implicated in the stress response, chloroplast function and polarized secretion. In this review, we focus on recent findings in the family of Sac domain-containing PI phosphatases in yeast, mammal and plant, including the structural analysis into the mechanism of enzymatic activity, cellular functions, and their roles in disease pathophysiology.","lipid metabolism, membrane trafficking, function, bioinformatics, biomedical research"
"Proteomics is the study of structures and functions of proteins, while metabolomics is the study of small-molecule metabolites in the cells, tissues, and organs of the organism. Proteomic technologies have wide applications in medical field. The current revolution in proteomics has led to the discovery of several new protein markers for various disorders. Urinary proteomics and metabolomics have also evolved in the recent years, for the diagnosis of both renal and nonrenal disorders. The urinary proteome varies in normal and abnormal conditions. Different techniques are employed for the analysis of pediatric urinary proteome, the commonest being MS. Before introduction into clinical use, there is the need for careful standardization. Available data suggest that there are differences in urinary proteome between adult and pediatric populations. It is noted that infant urine contains proteins involved in translation and transcription, cellular growth, and metabolic processes, which are not predominant in adult urine. Available data on urinary proteomic and metabolomic profile in common pediatric disorders are also reviewed here.","biomarkers, mass spectrometry, metabolomics, pediatric disorders, urinary proteome profile"
"This paper is dedicated to three-dimensional simulation of hemming of an automotive hood. The results from the simulations are compared with measurements on hoods manufactured in the production line, both with and without adhesives, in order to check the validity of the FE-model. Both the ordinary serial version as well as the massively parallel processing (MPP)-version of the code LS-DYNA have been applied in the simulations, in order to verify that the two versions are giving the same results, and thereby ensuring that the MPP-version can be used for this type of simulations. Four different types of under-integrated shell elements, three of them based on the Mindlin shell theory and one based on a degenerated solid element, have been used in order to determine which of them is showing the best agreement with test results. Furthermore, results from a transversely anisotropic material model are compared to results from a model with full anisotropy in order to study if anisotropy is a crucial issue in these simulations. One simulation was performed of the case with adhesives between the parts. The effects on the roll-in of the adhesives were in this simulation modelled as a smaller friction coefficient in the contacts between the two parts. Finally, the effect on roll-in from the preceding stamping is studied in an FE-model with pre-strained outer and inner parts.","joining, sheet metal forming, explicit fe-method, hemming, anisotropic material, three dimensional, massively parallel processing"
"A three-dimensional mathematical model has been developed to simulate the response of steel structures in the event of a fire. The model using isoparametric shell finite elements is based on a tangential stiffness approach which allows sophisticated simulations to be executed economically. The model includes the consideration of the material plasticity and deterioration with temperature, non-uniform thermal expansion across a section and large deformations at very high temperatures. Analyses are undertaken using time steps. This allows the complete account of stress history of the structure, especially when the rate of temperature rise differs in different parts of the structure. Comparisons are made with the test data obtained from real fire tests on both steel beams with different support and loading conditions, and with beam-to-column connections. Both the simulated deflection-time curve and fire resistance period are found to be in good agreement with the test evidence.","fire resistance, finite element, thermal expansion, three dimensional, mathematical model, difference in differences"
"Reinforced concrete (RC) short columns are vulnerable to brittle shear failure during an earthquake. The objective of this research is to evaluate the performance enhancement of RC short columns tubed with circular or square tubes. Eight short columns were tested under combined constant axial load and cyclic lateral load. The tested specimens included three circular tubed RC (CTRC) columns and three square tubed RC (STRC) columns. Two common RC short columns including one circular RC column and one square RC column were also tested as control specimens. The test results indicated that common RC short columns suffered brittle shear failure with little ductility, while the ductility of tubed RC short columns was excellent due to the effective confinement of the outer thin tube to the core concrete. The lateral load strength of CTRC short columns increases with the increasing of axial load ratio, while the axial load ratio has little effect on the plastic deformation capacity of CTRC short columns. The shear strength increases with increasing of axial load ratio, while the plastic deformation capacity decreases with increasing of axial load ratio for STRC short columns. A circular tube prevents the core concrete from shear failure more effectively than a square tube for the tubed RC short columns. A modified ACI design method is adopted to calculate the nominal shear strength of STRC columns as well as CTRC columns based on the test and analysis results.","Tubed RC short column, Axial load ratio, Nominal shear strength, Ductility, Shear failure"

"Chiari malformation, functional cranial settling and subtle forms of basilar invagination result in biomechanical neuraxial stress, manifested by bulbar symptoms, myelopathy and headache or neck pain. Finite element analysis is a means of predicting stress due to load, deformity and strain. The authors postulate linkage between finite element analysis (FEA)-predicted biomechanical neuraxial stress and metrics of neurological function.A prospective, Internal Review Board (IRB)-approved study examined a cohort of 5 children with Chiari I malformation or basilar invagination. Standardized outcome metrics were used. Patients underwent suboccipital decompression where indicated, open reduction of the abnormal clivo-axial angle or basilar invagination to correct ventral brainstem deformity, and stabilization/ fusion. FEA predictions of neuraxial preoperative and postoperative stress were correlated with clinical metrics.Mean follow-up was 32 months (range, 7-64). There were no operative complications. Paired t tests/ Wilcoxon signed-rank tests comparing preoperative and postoperative status were statistically significant for pain, bulbar symptoms, quality of life, function but not sensorimotor status. Clinical improvement paralleled reduction in predicted biomechanical neuraxial stress within the corticospinal tract, dorsal columns and nucleus solitarius.The results are concurrent with others, that normalization of the clivo-axial angle, fusion-stabilization is associated with clinical improvement. FEA computations are consistent with the notion that reduction of deformative stress results in clinical improvement. This pilot study supports further investigation in the relationship between biomechanical stress and central nervous system (CNS) function.","Chiari malformation, clivo-axial angle, craniocervical junction, deformative stress, finite element analysis, stretch myelopathy"
"Recent research suggests that architectural knowledge, such as design decisions, is important and should be recorded alongside the architecture description. Different approaches have emerged to support such architectural knowledge (AK) management activities. However, there are different notions of and emphasis on what and how architectural activities should be supported. This is reflected in the design and implementation of existing AK tools. To understand the current status of software architecture knowledge engineering and future research trends, this paper compares five architectural knowledge management tools and the support they provide in the architecture life-cycle. The comparison is based on an evaluation framework defined by a set of 10 criteria. The results of the comparison provide insights into the current focus of architectural knowledge management support, their advantages, deficiencies, and conformance to the current architectural description standard. Based on the outcome of this comparison a research agenda is proposed for future work on AK tools.","architectural knowledge management tool, current architectural description standard, architecture life-cycle, architectural knowledge management support, current focus, comparative study, design rationale, architectural design, architectural knowledge, ak tool, architecture knowledge management tool, architectural activity, software architecture knowledge engineering, architecture description"
"Bacteriorhodopsin (BR) is a membrane protein which pumps protons through the plasma membrane. Seven transmembrane BR helical segments are subjected to simulation studies in order to investigate the packing process of transmembrane helices. A Monte Carlo simulated annealing protocol is employed to optimize the helix bundle system. Helix packing is optimized according to a semi-empirical potential mainly composed of six components: a bilayer potential, a crossing angle potential, a helix dipole potential, a helix-helix distance potential, a helix orientation potential and a helix-helix distance restraint potential (a loop potential). Necessary parameters are derived from theoretical studies and statistical analysis of experimentally determined protein structures. The structures from the simulations are compared with the experimentally determined structures in terms of geometry. The structures generated show similar shapes to the experimentally suggested structure even without the helix-helix distance restraint potential. However, the relative locations of individual helices were reproduced only when the helix-helix distance restraint potential was used with restraint conditions. Our results suggest that transmembrane helix bundles resembling those observed experimentally may be generated by simulations using simple potentials.","protein structure, transmembrane helix, simulated annealing, simulation, membrane protein, bacteriorhodopsin, statistical analysis, monte carlo, monte carlo simulation"
"Pressure-volume and lung compliance/kg determinations were made in a total of 45 preterm lambs during gas ventilation (GR I: n = 31; 122-140 days gestation; 3.3-3.9 kg birthweight and liquid fluorocarbon (RIMAR 101) ventilation (GR II: n = 14; 106-138 days gestation; 1.1-3.4 kg birthweight. After effective ventilation (PaO2 > 60mmHg; PaCO2 = 30-45mmHg) and acid-base status (pH = 7.25 - 7.45) were achieved, pulmonary function was evaluated. Regression analysis showed significantly different relationships between lung compliance and developmental age for GR I (r = 0.95) and GR II (r = 0.99). Compliance for GR II lambs was consistently greater than for GR I lambs, this difference did not become significant until after 125 days gestation. These results indicate that minimizing interfacial surface tension has little effect on lung compliance in animals at earlier gestational ages, therefore suggesting that morphologic and tissue properties predominate surface properties in limiting lung distensibility. By defining the stage of development in which pulmonary function is most effectively improved by reduced surface tension, these findings suggest age-related criteria regarding the benefit of exogenous surfactant replacement therapy.

"In this paper an extension of the method of the Fourier series expansion to the fire analysis of composite beams is presented. In particular the extension concerns the introduction of the temperature dependent interaction of all the components: steel beams, concrete slab and steel connectors. These last are considered of finite stiffness, and a proper account is given to the combined effect of thermal degradation of the properties, and stress amplification caused by the differential thermal expansion across the interface. The proposed method compares very well with some experimental fire tests of simply supported and framed composite beams. Due to its relative simplicity and speed, it can be used for design purposes in evaluating the critical temperature in terms of critical deflection. Finally we recall that the method is capable of dealing with every type of fastening distribution, such as discontinuous or variable length.","finite stiffness connector, test comparison, composite beams, fire resistance, analytical prediction, critical deflection, fourier series, thermal expansion"
"To examine associations between a series of sociodemographic factors, childhood experiences, and mental disorders and risk of serious suicide attempt in young people aged 13 through 24 years and to explore the joint relationship between these factors and vulnerability to serious suicide attempt.The study used a case-control design in which a sample of 129 young people who had made serious suicide attempts was contrasted with 153 randomly selected community controls. Measures included sociodemographic factors (educational qualifications, annual income, residential mobility), childhood experiences (parental relationship, parental care, childhood sexual abuse), and psychiatric morbidity.On the basis of multiple logistic regression, those making serious suicide attempts reported elevated rates of sociodemographic disadvantage (p < .0001), higher rates of disadvantageous childhood experiences (p < .05), and elevated rates of psychiatric morbidity (p < .0001).Risks of serious suicide attempt among young people increased with extent of exposure to childhood adversity, social disadvantage, and psychiatric morbidity, with each of these factors making independent contributions to risk of serious suicide attempt.","childhood experiences, sociodemographic factors, mental disorder, risk factors, serious suicide attempts, human factors, occupational safety, suicide prevention, ergonomics, injury prevention"
"Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the procedure of choice for gallbladder removal in children, the treatment of children who have choledocholithiasis remains unclear. For adults who have suspected choledocholithiasis, preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a well-described and effective approach, however, its use for common bile duct stones in children has not been defined. The authors reviewed the records of 131 consecutive children undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy on two surgical services to define the efficacy of ERCP followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy in managing choledocholithiasis in children. Fourteen children were suspected of having common duct stones noted on preoperative ultrasound scan and laboratory data. At ERCP, six children had no stones visualized; eight had stones and underwent stone extraction and sphincter dilation or sphincterotomy. All 14 underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy a mean of 3.8 days after ERCP. None of the 14 had evidence of retained stones. Only one of 117 children undergoing primary laparoscopic cholecystectomy had unsuspected common bile duct stones and was treated with laparoscopic common bile duct exploration and stone removal. A management plan incorporating ERCP followed by early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe and effective strategy for children who have choledocholithiasis.","endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, choledocholithiasis, common bile duct stones, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, ultrasound"
"Much attention has been given to the impact that free trade agreements have had on member countries. There has been relatively little attention given to the impact on nonmembers, especially as it relates to both trade and FDI. This paper uses a gravity model framework to estimate the impact that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) had on U.S. trade and FDI relationships with both member and nonmember countries. The estimated impacts are refined to account for each country's level of development. The results confirm many previous studies on the ability of the standard gravity model to explain trade and FDI patterns. This study goes further and establishes that there are additional impacts related to both membership in the NAFTA and levels of development.","fdi, trade, nafta, gravity model"
"When people become patients, they place their trust in their health care providers. As providers assume responsibility for their diagnosis and treatment, patients have a right to expect that this will include responsibility for their safety during all aspects of care. However, increasing epidemiological data make it clear that patient safety is a global problem. Improved nursing care may prevent many adverse events, and nursing must take a stronger leadership role in this area. Although errors are almost inevitable, safety can be improved, and health care institutions are increasingly making safety a top priority. Information technology provides safety benefits by enhancing communication and delivering decision-support; its use will likely be a cornerstone for improving safety. This paper will discuss the status of patient safety from an international viewpoint, provide case studies from different countries, and discuss information technology solutions from a nursing perspective.","information technology, adverse event, decision support, health care"
"The paper describes an experimental investigation of a new earthquake damper, the yielding shear panel device (YSPD), for civil structures. It utilizes energy dissipation through plastic shear deformation of a thin diaphragm steel plate welded inside a square hollow section (SHS). Its performance is verified by nineteen monotonic and cyclic tests. Experiments showed that certain specimens exhibited stable behavior and were capable of dissipating a significant amount of energy. The performance is influenced by the diaphragm plate slenderness and by the in-plane rigidity of the surrounding SHS. Slender plates undergo elastoplastic shear buckling and exhibit stable though slightly pinched hysteresis response. Stocky plates impose high deformation demand on the surrounding SHS that hinders their cyclic performance. The equivalent viscous damping offered by the test specimens, on their own, and the cumulative energy dissipation are quantified. Fabrication, implementation and replacement of the damper proved to be easy and inexpensive. The YSPD offers a potentially viable alternative for seismic retrofitting of existing frame structures.","yielding shear panel, seismic retrofitting, energy dissipation, cumulant, shear deformation"

"This study investigates the effects of cultural conditioning, product type, and benefit claim type on attitudes and brand personality perceptions among consumers from a society that is more culturally conditioned towards utilitarian consumption (Shanghai, China) and an economy that is less culturally conditioned towards utilitarian consumption (Singapore). Our findings reveal that consumers in Shanghai preferred ads promoting utilitarian rather than hedonic products. They also rated brands of utilitarian products as more sophisticated, competent, exciting, and sincere than hedonic products. No such difference was observed among Singaporeans. These consumers preferred hedonic over utilitarian products but did not perceive them as being different from utilitarian products in terms of brand personality. Theoretical and managerial implications are forwarded, together with directions for future research.","hedonic consumption, cultural conditioning, utilitarian consumption, person perception"
"This paper contributes to the knowledge of the impact of the multi-channel strategy by analyzing its effects on one key aspect of the behavior of financial services customers. We analyze the factors influencing the extent of multi-channel shopping. Using a customer database, the study estimates one latent class regression model to control for heterogeneity, finding that customers' acquisition of diverse financial products and services and the total number of financial services are antecedents of multi-channel behavior. The study contributes a new measure to better assess the level of multi-channel consumer behavior.","latent class regression, multi-channel behavior, financial services, entropy, consumer behavior, regression model"
"In paper-based workflow systems, signatures of individuals or groups of people have been used extensively for various purposes. Currently there are numerous studies on computerizing workflow systems. Also there are studies on implementing digital signatures in electronic media. But the diversified purposes of a signature in workflow makes a straight-forward implementa- tion of digital signature schemes inadequate. There are few studies on the implication of different signature purposes on electronic workflow systems. The purposes of signatures are closely associated with the two modes of deci- sion making, namely single and group. These two modes of decision making in turn lead to single and group signatures. This paper reports our compre- hensive studies on signature purposes. These include the analysis of com- mon signature purposes in workflow, classification of these purposes, mode of decision making associated with these signature purposes and their clas- sifications, a design of data structure which can capture these information for processing in workflow systems, signing and validation requirements for handling these signature purposes, and finally an architecture to be incorpo- rated in workflow engine for handling these signature purposes. In summary, this paper addresses a commonly neglected problem in in- formation systems research: management control by signature in workflow.","workflow system, signature purpose, secure workflow, signature purposes, group signature, digital signature, electronic media, data structure, management control"
"Competitive pressures are forcing many companies to aggressively pursue software quality improvement based on software complexity metrics. A metrics database is often the key to a successful ongoing software metrics program. Contel had a successful metrics program that involved project-level metrics databases and planned a corporate level database. The U.S. Army has established a minimum set of metrics for Army software development and maintenance covering the development process, software quality, and software complexity. This program involves a central Army-wide metrics database and a validation program. In light of the importance of corporate metrics databases and the prevalence of multicolliner metrics, we define the contribution of any proposed metric in terms of the measured variation, irrespective of the metric's usefulness in quality models. This is of interest when full validation is not practical. We review two approaches to assessing the contribution of a new software complexity metric to a metrics database and present a new method based on information theory. The method is general and does not presume any particular set of metrics. We illustrate this method with three case studies, using data from full-scale operational software systems. The new method is less subjective than competing assessment methods.","software metric, information theory-based approach, development process, information theory, software complexity, software development, software systems, software quality"
"Different concentrations of dysprosium (Dy 3+ ) doped gadolinium aluminates (GdAlO 3 ) have been newly synthesized by the wet chemical route method. Very fine particles in the nanometer range could be prepared by this method, as evidenced by X-ray diffraction and SEM measurements. The XRD profile confirms their orthorhombic nature, which is well correlated with the reported results. Luminescence studies on these compounds have been carried out on the emission and excitation, along with lifetime measurements. Such luminescent powders are expected to find potential applications as new optical materials. The emission procedure in the system has also been elucidated by an energy level scheme.","pl, dy 3+ :gdalo 3, 32.50.+d, ple, xrd"
"The materials used in the field of ground transportation are becoming increasingly complex and it is usual to find numerous composite parts. The potential for utilization is generally verified through the numerical simulations, especially due to the increase in severe safety criteria. This paper deals with a finite element intended to describe numerically the behaviour of multi-layered multi-materials (combination of metallic and composite plies). A complete description of this element is presented with the taking into account of the resin ductility and the asymmetrical tension/compression behaviour for composite plies. The latter are performed by the introduction of an isotropic hardening law and a compressive multiplier depending on strain. Some numerical validations will be produced to verify the developments.","C. Finite element analysis, B. Impact behaviour, A. Layered structures, Multi-material"
"To investigate whether ""social communication"" could be used to assess severity of symptoms in autism spectrum disorder. Social communication refers to the communication of cognitive and emotional information through facial expression, gesture, and prosody and through implicit understanding of pragmatics and of theory of mind.Subjects were evaluated by raters using the Autism Diagnostic interview-Revised and either the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule or the Pre-Linguistic Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Two investigators independently diagnosed autism, Asperger's disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified in 63 subjects. Items from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised that were judged to represent social communication behaviors were factor-analyzed.Three factors were identified: affective reciprocity, joint attention, and theory of mind. Comparing this new classification approach to DSM-IV led to suggestions for possible changes in the latter: (1) Vocabulary and grammar deficiencies in autistic persons should be coded under developmental language disorder, (2) The diagnosis of Asperger's disorder may not be needed. (3) Requiring that all persons with autism spectrum disorder have a symptom from the ""restrictive, repetitive, and stereotypic"" list may need to be reconsidered.The DSM-IV category of pervasive developmental disorder may be ideal for diagnosing ""classic"" autism, but it may be inadequate for diagnosing less severe forms of the disorder.","autism, diagnosis, autism spectrum disorder, asperger's disorder, social communication, facial expression"

"Road traffic flow parameters are the important basic information for traffic safety management, traffic condition evaluation and decision-making. This project designs a video-based traffic flow parameters monitoring terminal (ITS monitoring terminal), which is based on MENLOW embedded platform and expands its hardware and software resources. CCD cameras are used to capture image in video sequences in traffic environment. Image processing and analysis technologies are used to track vehicles and analyze the vehicle conditions in real time, and a vision measurement model which computes the traffic flow parameters, such as length, width, speed, distance between two vehicles, traffic flow density, and occupancy ratios, etc. is constructed. Furthermore, BP neural network is used to classify vehicles.

"In this paper, we expound the network view of strategic alliances and apply it to a developing country, namely Taiwan. We find that Taiwanese firms are keenly interested in forming strategic alliances with larger, reputable foreign firms, but that they have no particular interest, or ability, in forming horizontal alliances aimed at controlling competitive uncertainties. Through asymmetric alliances, Taiwanese firms gain access to new markets and new technologies. We point to resource commitment and organizational integration as two important components of strategic alliances, where a high degree of resource interdependency precipitates nonequity alliances, especially those involving serious resource commitments. We also find that large firms are more inclined to engage in equity joint ventures than small firms.","resource interdependency, resource commitment, asymmetric alliances, developing country"
"To assess the interaction of bilirubin with albumin and to determine the site of bilirubin toxicity in cells, a study was made of the O2- production of neonatal neutrophils (PMNs) by two different stimulators: (1) concanavalin A (Con A) plus cytochalasin D (Cyt D), which acts on the cell surface, and (2) phorbol myristate acetate, which acts intracellularly. PMNs that had been separated from cord blood were incubated for 60 min at 37 degrees C in the solution with different molar ratios of bilirubin/albumin (unbound bilirubin, ranging from 0.35 to 3.92 micrograms/dl). The unbound bilirubin was determined by peroxidase oxidation method. A PMN viability of more than 96% was maintained after the incubation in each of solutions. The O2- production rate of PMNs stimulated by Con A plus Cyt D was inhibited in the presence of unbound bilirubin levels as low as 1.12 micrograms/dl, and the rate decreased as the levels of unbound bilirubin rose. The O2- production rate stimulated by Con A plus Cyt D was more remarkably inhibited than that by phorbol myristate acetate, which directly activates intracellular protein kinase C. These findings suggest that bilirubin toxicity to PMN can be shown at levels of unbound bilirubin as low as those in hyperbilirubinemic sera, and the critical site at which bilirubin exerts its toxicity is mainly in membrane level rather than on intracellular functions.","protein kinase c, concanavalin, concanavalin a, peroxidase"

"Watermarking is used to protect the integrity and copyright of images. Conventional copyright protection mechanisms; however, are not robust enough or require complex computations to embed the watermark into the host image. In this article, we propose an adaptive copyright protection scheme without the use of discrete cosine transformation (DCT) and discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). This novel approach allows image owners to adjust the strength of watermarks through a threshold, so that the robustness of the watermark can be enhanced. Moreover, our scheme can resist various signal processing operations (such as blurring, JPEG compression, and noising) and geometric transformations (such as cropping, rotation, and scaling). The experimental results show that our scheme outperforms related works in most cases. Specifically, our scheme preserves the data lossless requirement, so it is suitable for medical and artistic images.","lossless images, geometric transformation, jpeg compression, sobel, image owner, conventional copyright protection mechanism, digital signature, adaptive copyright protection scheme, copyright protection, torus automorphism, adaptive watermark mechanism, digital watermarking, host image, discrete cosine transformation, discrete wavelet transformation, rightful ownership protection, artistic image, complex computation, discrete cosine transform, discrete wavelet transform, crop rotation, digital watermark, signal processing"
"Electronic health records (EHRs) are increasingly used in healthcare settings and it is believed that they have brought benefits to patients and healthcare services alike. Few previous studies, however, have explored the impact of these records on patient safety.The overall purpose of this study was to explore the effect of EHRs on patient safety, as perceived by nurses.This qualitative exploratory study was conducted using semi-structured interviews with staff nurses working in hospitals that employed the same EHR system in Jordan. Seventeen nurses were interviewed working in various units and wards of ten hospitals which had used EHRs between 1 and 5 years. Field notes were taken during interviews and analyzed thematically.Two major themes emerged from the data. One regarded the enhancements that EHRs have made to patient safety; and the other surrounded concerns raised by the use of these systems. Under each main theme there were four subthemes. EHRs directly or indirectly improved patient safety by minimizing medication errors, improving documentation of data, enhancing the completeness of data, and improving the sustainability of data. The interviewees expressed concern that the following may jeopardize patient safety: data entry errors, technical problems, minimal clinical alerts, and poor use of system communication channels.A range of opinions were reported by the interviewees, from being fully supportive of EHRs to being reluctant to agree with the idea that they can improve patient safety. However, the concerns raised by the interviewees might be associated with poor system design or improper human use of the system. Thus, it is necessary to design systems with specifications that support patient safety and, moreover, involving nurses in this process might facilitate this outcome.","Electronic health records, interviews, patient, qualitative, safety"
"In the present study we examined the incidence of psychiatric and behavioral problems among male carriers of the fragile X gene.Retrospective data on carrier males were gathered using the family informant method. Each of 56 fragile X carrier women was interviewed about her father by an examiner blind to the father's carrier status. The interviewer administered measures of (1) behaviors related to DSM-III-R Axis I disorders, (2) adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) behaviors, (3) parental bonding skills, and (4) abusive behaviors. The endorsements from 24 women with fragile X fathers were compared with endorsements from 32 women with nonfragile X fathers.The results show a higher incidence of psychopathology among the fragile X males (relative to nonfragile X fathers) for behaviors related to adult ADHD, parental bonding, abuse; and particularly for alcohol abuse/dependence and obsessive-compulsive disorder behaviors.These findings support the hypotheses that some ""nonpenetrant"" males may indeed be mildly affected carriers and that there is a broad spectrum of involvement among carrier males.","behavioral disorders, fragile x, psychopathology, psychiatric disorders, carrier males"
Two mentally retarded boys with autism and one mentally retarded girl with Down syndrome were taught to initiate and play a ball game with an adult confederate. The program targeted both nonverbal responses related to the actual execution of the ball game as well as verbal responses for play initiation and providing compliments for the confederate's behavior. Training sessions provided ample practice in all aspects of the game from initiation to termination through use of brief play cycles. Instruction was provided using a combination of physical and verbal prompts as well as reinforcement and time-out. All three children learned the game and by the study's completion executed multiple play cycles each session.

"Nowadays, organizations face with a very high competitiveness and for this reason they have to continuously improve their processes. Two key aspects to be considered in the software processes management in order to promote their improvement are their effective modeling and evaluation. The integrated management of these key aspects is not a trivial task, the huge number and diversity of elements to take into account makes it complex the management of software processes. To ease and effectively support this management, in this paper we propose FMESP: a framework for the integrated management of the modeling and measurement of software processes. FMESP incorporates the conceptual and technological elements necessary to ease the integrated management of the definition and evaluation of software processes. From the measurement perspective of the framework and in order to provide the support for the software process measurement at model level a set of representative measures have been defined and validated.","conceptual framework, high competitiveness, software process modeling, software measurement, effective modeling, software process measurement, model level, measurement perspective, representative measure, huge number, software engineering environment, integrated management, software process, key aspect"
"This paper describes two series of load tests on slender composite columns: eight tests on concrete filled rectangular hollow steel section columns and seven tests on concrete encased rolled steel joist columns, both with end eccentricities producing moments other than single curvature bending. In all tests, normal strength concrete of grade C25/30 and low strength steel of grade S275 were specified. The main objectives of these tests were twofold: first, to provide test information for the calibration of Eurocode 4 against BS 5400 for slender composite columns and secondly to assess the accuracy of a new design method for composite columns, based on the well established steel column approach in BS 5950. Comparisons are made between predicted column strengths using the three different methods and between various predictions and test results. It is found from these comparisons that all three methods are conservative and have similar overall accuracy. For concrete filled composite columns, the Eurocode 4 method appears to be more accurate than the BS 5400 method. The proposed design method, which is based on the steel column approach in BS 5950, gives predicted column strengths comparable to those from the Eurocode 4 method. It also gives a clear understanding of the behaviour of a composite column. However, the main advantages of the proposed method are its simplicity and the savings in design time.","composite columns, design method, calibration, double curvature"
"The main goal of this study was the development of a reliable intervention to overcome general procrastination orientated to college students, designed to be used in practical clinical work. The workshops involved six meetings based on behavioral and cognitive techniques, paradox intervention, and psychoeducation. 175 students participated voluntarily. Their procrastination levels were measured in a pretest, post-test, and a 3-month follow-up. After the first interview, the participants were randomly divided into three groups (Intervention A, Intervention B, and a control group with no intervention). There was a significant improvement after the intervention. After 3 months, the average score was still significantly lower than in the pretest, whereas the score of the control group remained unchanged. The participants in Workshop A scored significantly lower in the post-test than the ones in Workshop B. After 3 months, the participants in Workshop B scored significantly lower in the follow up. So both interventions resulted to be effective in reducing procrastination sustainably.","Behavioral cognitive therapy, general procrastination, group treatment, paradox intervention"

"Cost estimation is one of the most critical activities in software life cycle. In past decades, a number of techniques have been proposed for cost estimation. Linear regression is yet the most frequently applied method in the literature. However, a number of studies point out that linear regression is prone to low prediction accuracy. The low prediction accuracy is due to a number of reasons such as non-linearity and non-normality. One less addressed reason is the multi-collinearities which may lead to unstable regression coefficients. On the other hand, it has been reported that multi-collinearity spreads widely across the software engineering datasets. To tackle this problem and improve regression's accuracy, we propose a holistic problem-solving approach (named adaptive ridge regression system) integrating data transformation, multi-collinearity diagnosis, ridge regression technique and multi-objective optimization. The proposed system is tested on two real world datasets with the comparisons with OLS regression, stepwise regression and other machine learning methods. The results indicate that adaptive ridge regression system can significantly improve the performance of regressions on multi-collinear datasets and produce more explainable results than machine learning methods.","stepwise regression, ridge regression, adaptive ridge regression system, unstable regression coefficient, software cost, low prediction accuracy, software cost estimation, ols regression, linear regression, cost estimation, multi-collinear datasets, proposed system, machine learning, multi-collinearity, ridge regression technique, multi collinearity, software engineering, multi objective optimization, system integration, software life cycle, data transformation"
"We consider a general equilibrium model of an economy with increasing returns to scale or more general types of nonconvexity and without ordered preferences. Firms are instructed to set their prices according to general pricing rules which may depend on the production plans of other firms. We suppose, moreover, that the pricing rule of the firms verifies a condition of weak bounded losses. This includes the case of profit maximizing, average cost pricing and marginal (cost) pricing, thanks to a transformation used by Bonnisseau. The tastes of the consumers may depend both on other consumptions and on the prices This paper reports a general existence result in this model which extends the results of Bonnisseau and Cornet.","90A14, general equilibrium theory, increasing returns, marginal pricing rule, Clarke cone, fixed-point theory"
"A method for determining the optimal testing period and measuring the production yield is discussed. With the increased complexity of VLSI circuits, testing has become more costly and time-consuming. The design of a testing strategy, which is specified by the testing period based on the coverage function of the testing algorithm, involves trading off the cost of testing and the penalty of passing a bad chip as good. The optimal testing period is first derived, assuming the production yield is known. Since the yield may not be known a priori, an optimal sequential testing strategy which estimates the yield based on ongoing testing results, which in turn determines the optimal testing period, is developed next. Finally, the optimal sequential testing strategy for batches in which N chips are tested simultaneously is presented. The results are of use whether the yield stays constant or varies from one manufacturing run to another.","VLSI, fault tolerant computing, integrated circuit testing, VLSI testing strategy, coverage function, optimal design, production yield, sequential analysis"
"To investigate the antidepressant effect of high-dose milnacipran, we retrospectively compared three groups of inpatients with major depression; those who were given milnacipran >100-150 mg/day (high-dose milnacipran group), those treated with milnacipran at maximum doses of 50-100 mg/day (standard-dose milnacipran group), and those treated with paroxetine at maximum doses of 40 mg/day (paroxetine group). The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores of the three groups showed significant decrease at discharge compared to the scores at admission, indicating improvement of depressive symptoms for each group. However, the mean HAM-D score on admission was significantly lower for the standard-dose milnacipran group than the high-dose milnacipran and paroxetine groups. Additional intermediate assessment of the high-dose milnacipran group showed that the effect of milnacipran was dose-dependent with an additional improvement when patients were increase from 100 to 150 mg/day. These results suggest that patients suffering from moderate to severe depression with relative high HAM-D scores may benefit from treatment with high-dose milnacipran.","dual-action antidepressant, high-dose, milnacipran, paroxetine, pharmacotherapy"
"Following a brief review of the light-driven reactions in photosynthetic membranes, two questions are addressed. (1) Why is the first charge separation reaction in photosynthetic reaction centers so fast; and (2) given what we know about the contemporary structure and function of reaction centers, can we develop a simple model for a much more primitive reaction center? It is proposed that the primary charge separation step in reaction centers is optimized to be ultra-fast principally in order to compete with detrapping into the antenna complex, rather than to compete with radiative and non-radiative losses in the special pair. This leads to a notion of kinetic perfection analogous to that developed for enzymes which operate under diffusion-limited conditions, but elaborated to permit even more 'perfect' function. This hypothesis is testable by changing components in photosynthetic membranes and subjecting them to selective pressures. We speculate that the reaction center is far too complex to have served as an early functional unit, and consider possible roles for the iron-quinone part of the reaction center as a very primitive photosynthetic unit. It is suggested that this working end later became associated with primitive antenna complexes, which then evolved into the elaborate structure we find today.The role of photosynthesis in the origin of life has been a topic of speculation for many years. It is evident that photosynthetic function is ancient and central. As a person who does not work in the field of evolution. I am not very familiar with much of the speculation that precedes this paper. Proposals and speculation by others are likely based on much firmer ground, and therefore I apologize in advance if some of these ideas have already been suggested by others. In this chapter I take the liberty to speculate on how a structure as complex as the contemporary photosynthetic reaction center (RC) could have evolved from more primitive units, and why it retains some of its remarkable properties and seemingly unnecessary components. Both subjects lead to specific predictions and testable hypotheses.","reaction center, kinetic perfection, photosynthetic reaction center, functional unit, iron, kinetics, enzyme"
"Subcontracting is a long-established practice in the construction industry to capitalise on the skills of trade specialists and to cope with the fluctuating construction demand. This mechanism if managed properly could lead to an improvement in quality and reduction in project time and costs. However, in the absence of a rational framework for evaluating subcontracting, it is difficult to ascertain whether the subcontractors appointed are capable of completing the subcontracted tasks satisfactorily. With an increasing awareness of the problems caused by inferior subcontractors, some countries maintain a centralised subcontractor registration system so as to eliminate those incompetent subcontractors from being invited from bidding for a subcontract. To improve the transparency and objectivity of subcontractor registration necessitates the establishment of a set of evaluation criteria. Yet, as the types and sizes of subcontracting firms are so diverse, it is unsure whether a generic set of evaluation criteria can be applied universally. This paper reports the results of a survey aiming at identifying the key criteria for subcontractor registration. This paper examines the perceptions of different project stakeholders, and the differences between subcontractors of various scales and levels of skill are also highlighted.","trade specialist, evaluation criteria, registration scheme, subcontractor, construction industry"
"Hydrocephalus is a common medical condition characterized by abnormalities in the secretion,circulation or resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), resulting in ventricular dilatation. The pathogenetic mechanism for the hydrocephalus is attributed to: the overproduction of CSF by the choroid plexus; the defect in CSF absorption and obstruction of CSF flow in the cerebral ventricles. However, the underlying etiology is poorly understood. With the development of genetic engineering, a growing body of evidence indicates that genetic factors play an essential role in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus. It is the aim of this review to summarize these findings.","knockout, mice, multifactorial inheritance, hydrocephalus/etiol"
"Indigenous food fermentations are one of the oldest forms of biotechnology, although the potential of the associated microorganisms has probably not yet been fully realised. Many food fermentative microorganisms are highly domesticated, although few studies have attempted to assess the extent of the genetic resource which is available, or which strains should be preserved for the future. Many bacterial and fungal fermented foods are based on the utilization of solid substrates. Fundamental studies on these model sytems could provide the necessary information to enable a more efficient exploitation of solid substrates in modern biotechnology. Oppurtunities exist for the use of traditional fermentative microorganisms in biotechnology, either directly or following genetic manipulation using conventional or molecular techniques. Examples are presented to show the use of food fermentative and related microorganisms for the production of food colours, flavours, enzymes, antimicrobials and health products. Chitosan, a polymer present in the hyphae of food fermentative fungi has applications in the food, pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.","fermented foods, chitosan, biotechnological resources, solid substrates"
"We analyzed data from 145 maintenance and development projects managed by a single outsourcing company, including effort and duration estimates, effort and duration actuals, and function points counts. The estimates were made as part of the company's standard project estimating process that involved producing two or more estimates for each project and selecting one estimate to be the basis of client-agreed budgets. We found that effort estimates chosen as a basis for project budgets were, in general, reasonably good, with 63% of the estimates being within 25% of the actual value, and an average absolute error of 0.26. These estimates were significantly better than regression estimates based on adjusted function points, although the function point models were based on a homogeneous subset of the full data set, and we allowed for the fact that the model parameters changed over time. Furthermore, there was little evidence that the accuracy of the selected estimates was due to their becoming the target values for the project managers.","function points, duration estimate, development estimates, full data, estimation accuracy, effort, empirical study, duration actuals, maintenance estimates, standard project, project budget, project manager, function point model, development project, duration, development estimation accuracy, function points count, adjusted function point, function point"
"This paper presents and evaluates a new method for real-time task scheduling in multiprocessor systems. Its objectives are to minimize the number of processors required and the total tardiness of tasks. The minimization is carried out through a multiobjective genetic algorithm (GA), because the problem has non-commensurable and competing objectives to be optimized. The experimental results showed that when compared to five methods used previously, such as list-scheduling algorithms and a specific GA, the performance of our algorithm was comparable or better for 178 out of 180 randomly generated task graphs. Also shown is the impact of the sparsity of a task graph on the performance of our algorithm.","multiobjective genetic algorithm, multiprocessor system, real-time task scheduling, real-time system, task graph, deadline, paper present, total tardiness, scheduling, specific ga, genetic-algorithm-based real-time task scheduling, list-scheduling algorithm, new method, multiple goal, real time, genetic algorithm, real time system, real time systems"
"This paper emphasizes to develop a hybrid detection scheme for broken rotor bar fault in induction motors. Since the power spectrum density estimation of classical multiple signal classification (MUSIC) possesses higher resolution with short-time samples compared with FFT, this paper applies MUSIC to detect broken rotor bar fault. And thus, the impacts of the fluctuation of stator current can be decreased to a certain extent because only short-time samples are necessary. The hybrid detection scheme can be realized by using continuous subdivision Fourier transform, self-adaptive filter, rotor slot harmonics based slip estimation and MUSIC techniques. Fault detection instances in laboratory demonstrate that the presented scheme can assure the detection sensitivity and reliability of broken rotor bar fault in induction motors.","fourier transforms, detection reliability, power spectrum density estimation, squirrel cage motors, rotor slot harmonic based slip estimation, rotors, squirrel cage induction motors, fft, classical multiple signal classification, acoustic signal detection, adaptive filters, fault diagnosis, broken rotor bar fault detection, self-adaptive filter, continuous subdivision fourier transform, music techniques, detection sensitivity, stator current fluctuation, noise, fault detection, multiple signal classification, adaptive filter, induction motor, induction motors, fourier transform"
"One difficulty in studying dengue virus (DENV) is the lack of an experimental model that reproduces the human disease. In a previous work, we have shown that BALB/c mice intraperitoneally inoculated with a DENV-2 isolate presented viremia and mild focal areas of liver injuries. In this study, mice were inoculated by the intravenous route and presented extensive damage areas in the liver tissue, which were evaluated by histopathological and ultrastructural analysis. Hepatic injury was noted mainly around the central vein and portal tracts. Damages consist of hepatocyte injury, including steatosis, swelling and necrosis. Further, erythrophagocytosis, intercellular edema and vascular damages were evident, including hemorrhage, which is characteristic of the dengue-induced hepatitis in human liver. Hepatic lesions were already noted 2 days post infection (p.i.), although effects were more extensive after the seventh day p.i. An increase in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase serum levels was detected 7 and 14 days p.i., respectively, and had correlation to hepatic lesions. Alterations caused by the DENV infection were self-limiting, with a remarkable reduction of all liver damages 49 days p.i. Virus antigens were detected in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and vascular endothelium, suggesting virus replication in these cells. In situ hybridization, using a probe that anneals in the virus negative RNA strand, showed positive reaction in hepatocytes and vascular endothelium cells of infected mice, thus confirming virus replication in such cells. In general, results revealed that this mouse model reproduces some histopathological effects observed in humans and supports previous findings indicating virus replication in the hepatic tissue.","dengue, schizophrenia, psychopharmacology, anxiety, viral replication, depression"
"1.Conflicts between large mammalian predators and humans present a challenge to conservation efforts, as these events drive human attitudes and policies concerning predator species. Unfortunately, generalities portrayed in many empirical carnivore landscape selection studies do not provide an explanation for a predator's occasional use of residential development preceding a carnivore-human conflict event. In some cases, predators may perceive residential development as a risk-reward tradeoff. 2.We examine whether state dependent mortality-risk sensitive foraging can explain an apex carnivore's (Puma concolor) occasional utilization of residential areas. We assess whether puma balance the risk and rewards in a system characterized by a gradient of housing densities ranging from wildland to suburban. Puma GPS location data, characterized as hunting and feeding locations, were used to assess landscape variables governing hunting success and hunting site selection. Hunting site selection behavior was then analyzed conditional on indicators of hunger state. 3.Residential development provided a high energetic reward to puma, based on increases in prey availability and hunting success rates associated with increased housing density. Despite a higher energetic reward, hunting site selection analysis indicated that pumas generally avoided residential development, a landscape type attributed with higher puma mortality risk. However, when a puma experienced periods of extended hunger, risk avoidance behavior toward housing waned. 4.This study demonstrates that an apex carnivore faces a tradeoff between acquiring energetic rewards and avoiding risks associated with human housing. Periods of hunger can help explain an apex predator's occasional use of developed landscapes and thus the rare conflicts in the wildland-urban interface. Apex carnivore movement behaviors in relation to human conflicts are best understood as a three-player community level interaction incorporating wild prey distribution.

"In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme to construct fountain codes that can provide unequal error protection (UEP) property. To reduce the coding complexity and improve the performance of previous duplicate UEP schemes in the literature, we implement different rate low-density parity-check codes instead of the duplication process and replace the high-complexity classical robust soliton distribution by low constant average degree distributions with high intermediate symbol recovery rates. Asymptotic analysis of both the duplicate scheme and our scheme is obtained by deriving unequal density evolution formulas over the binary erasure channel. Compared to previous UEP schemes, our scheme has lower complexity. Experimental results show that our scheme can obtain better decoding performance, especially for smaller input information length. Comparison of peak signal-noise ratio performance for the scalable video coding shows that, for moderate input information length, our scheme can provide a better basic video quality at lower overhead, but needs larger overhead to achieve a high video quality.","Encoding, Parity check codes, Complexity theory, Radio frequency, Streaming media, Multimedia communication, Video coding"
"Spider VS-3 mechanoreceptor neurons have a low-voltage-activated Ca2+ current that raises intracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+] when they are depolarized by agonists of GABAA receptors or fire action potentials. The Ca2+ rise produces negative feedback by modulating the mechanoreceptor current and regulates Ca2+- and voltage-activated K+ currents. However, nothing is known about Ca2+ buffering in VS-3 neurons. Dynamic changes in VS-3 neuron intracellular [Ca2+] were measured using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Oregon Green BAPTA-1 (OG488) to understand Ca2+ buffering and clearance. Intracellular OG488 concentration increased slowly over more than 2 h as it diffused through a sharp intracellular microelectrode and spread through the cell. This slow increase was used to measure endogenous Ca2+ buffering and clearance by the added buffer technique, with OG488 acting as both added exogenous buffer and Ca2+ indicator. [Ca2+] was raised for brief periods by regular action potential firing, produced by pulsed electric current injection through the microelectrode. The resulting rise and fall of [Ca2+] were well fitted by the single compartment model of Ca2+ dynamics. With earlier ratiometric [Ca2+] estimates, these data gave an endogenous Ca2+ binding ratio of 684. Strong Ca2+ buffering may assist these neurons to deal with rapid changes in mechanical inputs.","Cupiennius salei, Mechanosensory, Fluorescence, Single compartment, Calcium indicator"
"Glial peritoneal implants, commonly referred to as gliomatosis peritonei , are an occasional feature of ovarian teratomas. They are benign nodules of mature glial tissue and usually do not adversely affect outcome. We present the case of a 12-year-old girl who underwent excision of an immature ovarian teratoma, along with biopsies of multiple glial peritoneal implants. She also had a 2-cm right-sided pleural mass, which turned out to be normal glial tissue that was histologically indistinguishable from the peritoneal glial tissue. Pleural gliomatosis has not been described in the literature. The pathophysiology of gliomatosis peritonei was originally thought to be the direct extrusion or lymphatic spread of glial cells from the associated teratoma, although it has been postulated that the glial implants may instead be the result of pluripotent Mullerian stem cells that undergo metaplasia. This report provides evidence to bolster the metaplastic theory.","ovarian teratoma, gliomatosis peritonei, glial metaplasia, stem cell"
"Cryopreservation of human gametes and embryos has become an essential part of assisted reproduction. Successful cryopreservation of human blastocysts is increasingly relevant as extended in-vitro culture of human embryos becomes more common, permitting routine use of blastocyst transfer in IVF programmes. This reduces the number of embryos transferred, thereby reducing multiple pregnancies and maximizing cumulative pregnancy rates per oocyte retrieval. The superiority of blastocyst freezing over earlier stage freezing in terms of implantation per thawed embryo transferred improves overall expectations for the cryopreservation programme. Therefore, a reliable procedure for the cryopreservation of blastocysts is needed because, after transfer, only a small number of supernumerary blastocysts are likely to be available for cryopreservation. Since the early 1980s, two common techniques have been used in cryopreservation: the conventional slow cooling method and the more recent rapid procedure known as vitrification. Vitrification has become an attractive alternative to slow freezing, since it appears to result in significantly higher survival and pregnancy rates. The aim of this review is to focus on the cryopreservation of human blastocysts using slow and rapid protocols and to assess the impact of the crypreservation protocol used on the survival, implantation and pregnancy rates.","cryopreservation, vitrification, slow cooling, blastocyst, cumulant, embryos, embryo transfer"
"A metrological approach to calibration, from the analytical chemistry point of view, is discussed.

"Actinomyces is a genus of gram-positive anaerobic or microaerophilic bacteria that colonize the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and the female genital tract. These organisms cause disseminated disease in the mouth, the respiratory system, and rarely in the gastrointestinal tract. The diseases produced by Actinomyces species result from the disruption of the barriers that allow the dissemination of the bacteria through the surrounding tissues. The appendix is often a nidus of Actinomyces infection, but a prompt diagnosis cannot be made without the results of histologic examination of the appendix. The treatment of choice for actinomycosis of the appendix is the high-dose parenteral administration of penicillin G for 2 weeks immediately after the diagnosis has been made and continued oral treatment with that agent for at least the next 6 months. We present the case of a 13-year-old adolescent boy with actinomycosis of the appendix that was identified by histologic examination after appendectomy.","actinomycosis, appendix, children, actinomyces, respiratory system"
"We present new data on electron scattering from a range of nuclei taken in Hall C at Jefferson Lab. For heavy nuclei, we observe a rapid falloff in the cross section for $x>1$, which is sensitive to short range contributions to the nuclear wave-function, and in deep inelastic scattering corresponds to probing extremely high momentum quarks. This result agrees with higher energy muon scattering measurements, but is in sharp contrast to neutrino scattering measurements which suggested a dramatic enhancement in the distribution of the `super-fast' quarks probed at x>1. The falloff at x>1 is noticeably stronger in ^2H and ^3He, but nearly identical for all heavier nuclei.","wave functions, quarks, neutrinos, deep inelastic scattering, muons, scattering, electrons, distribution"
"Abstract Videotaped scenes of everyday events were shown to hospitalized abused and nonabused children and to a nonhospitalized peer group. The children's heart rates were taken as they viewed the scenes and they responded to questions about the content of the scenes. The hospitalized children reacted to the scenes with a larger decrease in heart rate than did the nonhospitalized children. The abused children reported more negative outcomes to the scenes, more negative feelings, and that they had experienced the events depicted more often than did either group of nonabused children.","abuse, heart rate, video scenes, attention"
"Recent research into the fire design of steel-framed structures has started to be steered away from considering isolated members towards considering the behaviour of the structure as a complete entity. In the UK, a recent series of fire tests have been conducted on a full scale composite test frame at the Building Research Establishment Laboratories at Cardington. This paper presents the computer simulation of one of these tests, carried out in the corner bay of the frame by the Building Research Establishment, using a purpose written program. Direct comparison between test results and computer predictions showed good correlation. Additional computer simulations were conducted to show that the windposts, which were used on the Cardington frame, had a significant effect on the structural behaviour of the frame. Other examples presented in this paper indicated that simplified idealised temperatures produced sufficiently accurate (although slightly conservative) predictions of structural deformations. The bridging action of the composite slab was also investigated using the computer software. It was shown that this mode of behaviour considerably reduced the deformations of the heated steel beams.","computer modelling, test-frame, fire tests, computer simulation"
"Portasystemic anastomoses continue to play an important role in the management of children with extrahepatic and intrahepatic portal venous obstruction. Postoperative documentation of shunt patency has depended upon demonstration of early caval filling with visceral angiography. This report details the use of real-time ultrasound in the demonstration of the patency of portasystemic anastomoses in seven children.

Real-time ultrasound is an accurate and noninvasive method for evaluating portasystemic anastomoses and should replace visceral angiography in most children.","portasystemic shunts, vascular ultrasound, abdominal ultrasound, portal hypertension, real time, ultrasound"
"An algorithm for motion adaptive field rate upconversion is described. It applies one of two low-pass vertical filters to the source signal, depending on whether the source is moving or static. The theory justifying this approach is also presented. In the case of high-definition multiplexed analog component (HD-MAC) signals, the motion adaptive control can be derived from the transmitted digitally assisted TV data, while for existing standards a motion detector is required. An algorithm for motion detection is also described. To improve the quality of moving images, an additional median filtering algorithm that can be applied after the vertical filtering is presented. The display standard of 900 lines, 100 Hz/2:1 is presented as an engineering compromise, allowing the construction of 100-Hz displays using conventional techniques while avoiding any compromise of the displayed image quality. A motion adaptive field rate upconverter has been constructed that converts either 1250- or 625-line 50-Hz inputs for display at 900 lines, 100 Hz.

It is then resolved in a decentralized manner where the surveillance area is divided into several zones equipped with calculators.

"Several distinct entities associated with dermal fibrosis can mimic scleroderma/systemic sclerosis. The list of scleroderma-like conditions or scleroderma variants includes eosinophilic fasciitis, localized forms of scleroderma, scleredema and scleromyxedema, keloids, and environmental exposure-associated conditions including eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and pseudosclerodermas induced by various drugs. Although these conditions are relatively uncommon, their accurate recognition is essential to avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate therapy. The pathogenesis of these scleroderma variants appears to share similarities with each other and with that of scleroderma. Better understanding of scleroderma-like disorders is emerging through epidemiologic investigations, and in vivo and in vitro experimental research. Activation of eosinophils and disordered regulation of fibroblast collagen synthesis, apoptosis, and proliferation are recurrent findings in these disorders. The etiologic role of infection with Borrelia species or other microorganisms remains controversial. Cytokines such as transforming growth factor-beta, interleukin-4, interleukin-13, and connective tissue growth factor contribute to fibrosis in these disorders by inducing an accentuated and persistent fibrogenic response to tissue injury. The role of genetic factors in susceptibility and clinical expression of scleroderma-like conditions remains to be systematically addressed. Because of the relative rarity of these conditions, few well-controlled clinical treatment trials have been performed. In addition, there is no consensus on optimal management. Much anecdotal information and small clinical series indicate that phototherapy may have a role in the treatment of scleroderma-like conditions.","Scleroderma, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Connective Tissue Growth Factor, Major Basic Protein, Localize Scleroderma"
"The four casein proteins in goat milk are encoded by four closely linked casein loci (CSN1S1, CSN2, CSN1S2 and CSN3) within 250 kb on caprine chromosome 6. A deletion in exon 12 of CSN1S1, so far reported only in Norwegian goats, has been found at high frequency (0.73). Such a high frequency is difficult to explain because the national breeding goal selects against the variant's effect.In this study, 575 goats were genotyped for 38 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) located within the four casein genes. Milk production records of these goats were obtained from the Norwegian Dairy Goat Control. Test-day mixed models with additive and dominance fixed effects of single SNP were fitted in a model including polygenic effects.Significant additive effects of single SNP within CSN1S1 and CSN3 were found for fat % and protein %, milk yield and milk taste. The allele with the deletion showed additive and dominance effects on protein % and fat %, and overdominance effects on milk quantity (kg) and lactose %. At its current frequency, the observed dominance (overdominance) effects of the deletion allele reduced its substitution effect (and additive genetic variance available for selection) in the population substantially.The selection pressure of conventional breeding on the allele with the deletion is limited due to the observed dominance (overdominance) effects. Inclusion of molecular information in the national breeding scheme will reduce the frequency of this deletion in the population.","Single Nucleotide Polymorphism, Milk Yield, Dominance Effect, Somatic Cell Count, Milk Production Trait"
"This study used a weight drop impact injury model to explore the role of iron and the reality of iron-catalyzed hydroxyl radical ((*)OH) formation in secondary spinal cord injury (SCI). The time course of total extracellular iron was measured following SCI by microcannula sampling and atomic absorption spectrophotometry analysis. Immediately following SCI, the total iron concentration increased from an undetectable level to an average of 1.32 microM. The time course of SCI-induced (*)OH-generating catalytic activity in the cord was obtained by determining the ability of tissue homogenate to convert hydrogen peroxide to (*)OH and then measuring 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, a hydroxylation product of salicylate. The concentration of 2,3-DHBA quickly and significantly increased (p <.001) and returned to sham level (p = 1) by 30 min post-SCI. Desferrioxamine (80 and 800 mg/kg body weight) significantly (p <.001) reduced the catalytic activity, suggesting that iron is the major contributor of the activity. Administering FeCl(3) (100 microM)/EDTA (0.5 mM) in ACSF into the cord through a dialysis fiber significantly increased SCI-induced (*)OH production in the extracellular space, demonstrating that Fe(3+) can catalyze (*)OH production in vivo. Our results support that iron-catalyzed (*)OH formation plays a role in the early stage of secondary SCI.","secondary spinal cord injury, catalytic activity, hplc analysis, iron-catalyzed hydroxyl radical formation, desferrioxamine, free radicals, hydrogen peroxide, microcannula sampling, fenton reaction, reactive oxygen species"

"The burgeoning growth of interactive media, and more specifically the Internet, as communication vehicles has inspired a flurry of market research that attempts to measure the impact of advertising in the new media, utilizing traditional advertising measurement methods. However, the full impact of these new media will not be realized unless we engage in more thorough research into how to evaluate their potential in terms of their influence on information search behavior. This article seeks to provide direction for such exploration by proposing a new model of consumer information search that integrates the principles of information economics and a goods classification model based on the search/experience/credence paradigm. This model will facilitate a greater understanding by marketers and academics of how a medium can influence consumer information search through its impact on the critical information consumers have access to prior to product usage.","market research, interactive media, information economics, new media"
"A design methodology aiming at the development of a collapse mechanism of a global type for eccentrically braced frames is presented in this paper. This result is of primary importance in earthquake resistant design, because partial and local failure modes are responsible of the worsening of the energy dissipation capacity leading to an increased risk of collapse under destructive ground motions. The proposed method is based on the assumption that horizontal member sections are known, as they are designed to resist internal actions due to vertical loads and design horizontal forces. Conversely, column and diagonal sections constitute the unknowns of the design problem. In particular, the presented approach also includes the influence of second order effects which are accounted for by means of the concept of mechanism equilibrium curve. The design requirements are derived by means of the kinematic theorem of plastic collapse. Column and diagonal sections are obtained by imposing that the mechanism equilibrium curve corresponding to the global mechanism has to lie below those corresponding to the undesired mechanisms within a displacement range compatible with the local ductility supply. Moreover, the introduction of the equivalent moment concept presented in a companion paper provides the proposed method with the ability to deal with short, intermediate and long links in the same manner. Aiming at the evaluation of the accuracy of the presented procedure, the inelastic performances of eccentrically braced frames designed by means of the proposed method are investigated, by means of static and dynamic non-linear analyses, in terms of collapse mechanism typology, available ductility and energy dissipation capacity.","local ductility demands, capacity design, limit design, collapse mechanism, static non-linear analysis, eccentrically braced frames, energy dissipation, failure mode, second order, design methodology"
"Fourier Transform Infrared Spectra of triple stranded polynucleotides containing homopurine dA or rA and homopyrimidine dT or rU strands have been obtained in H2O and D2O solutions as well as in hydrated films at various relative humidities. The spectra are interpreted by comparison with those of double stranded helixes with identical base and sugar composition. The study of the spectral domain corresponding to in-plane double bond stretching vibrations of the bases shows that whatever the initial duplex characterized by a different IR spectrum (A family form poly rA.poly rU, heternomous form poly rA.poly dT, B family form poly dA.poly dT), the triplexes present a similar IR spectrum reflecting similar base interactions. A particular attention is devoted to the 950-800 cm-1 region which contains marker bands of the sugar conformation in the nucleic acids. In solution the existence of only N (C3'endo-A family form) type of sugar pucker is detected in poly rU.poly rA.poly rU and poly dt.poly rA.poly rU. On the contrary absorption bands characteristic of both N (C3'endo-A family form) and S (C2'endo-B family form) type sugars are detected for poly rU.poly rA.poly dT, poly rU.poly dA.poly dT and poly dT.poly rA.poly dT. Finally mainly S (C2'endo-B family form) type sugars are observed in poly dT.poly dA.poly dT.","spectrum, nucleic acid, ftir spectroscopy, relative humidity"
"We have investigated the influence of the neurotoxic Alzheimer's disease peptide amyloid-beta (25-35) on the dynamics of phospholipid membranes by means of quasi-elastic neutron scattering in the picosecond time-scale. Samples of pure phospholipids (DMPC/DMPS) and samples with amyloid-beta (25-35) peptide included have been compared. With two different orientations of the samples the directional dependence of the dynamics was probed. The sample temperature was varied between 290K and 320K to cover both the gel phase and the liquid-crystalline phase of the lipid membranes. The model for describing the dynamics combines a long-range translational diffusion of the lipid molecules and a spatially restricted diffusive motion. Amyloid-beta (25-35) peptide affects significantly the ps-dynamics of oriented lipid membranes in different ways. It accelerates the lateral diffusion especially in the liquid-crystalline phase. This is very important for all kinds of protein-protein interactions which are enabled and strongly influenced by the lateral diffusion such as signal and energy transducing cascades. Amyloid-beta (25-35) peptide also increases the local lipid mobility as probed by variations of the vibrational motions with a larger effect in the out-of-plane direction. Thus, the insertion of amyloid-beta (25-35) peptide changes not only the structure of phospholipid membranes as previously demonstrated by us employing neutron diffraction (disordering effect on the mosaicity of the lipid bilayer system) but also the dynamics inside the membranes. The amyloid-beta (25-35) peptide induced membrane alteration even at only 3mol% might be involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease as well as be a clue in early diagnosis and therapy.","neutron scattering, diffusion coefficient, protein protein interaction, lipid bilayer, neutron diffraction"

The article focuses on how these students deal with the challenges and consequences that can arise from resisting the prevailing norms and practices. This article demonstrates that existing frameworks and categorizations in the contexts of anti-consumption, product and brand avoidance and coping are capable of providing useful theoretical tools for the examination of anti-consumption within the social marketing context. The article identifies some of the implicit tensions of being an anti-consumer in an environment of excessive consumption and provides examples of how consumers seek to manage these tensions. The use of the above theoretical perspectives can usefully inform policy that aims to promote sensible drinking among young people and students in particular.","social marketing, alcohol consumption, anti-consumption, coping, qualitative study, higher education"
"We assess Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN) performance in space under the scope of adjusting protocol data unit (PDU) size at various layers. We quantify the importance of combinatively adjusting size of DTN bundles, transport packets, and link frames. Through simulations, our paper reveals trade-offs that involve file delivery time, transmission effort of sending nodes, and memory resources release rate. Based on our findings, we propose a transport adaptation scheme that dynamically adjusts DTN bundle and transport packet size by means of heuristic search. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine transport segmentation policy and interaction among various layers of the DTN protocol stack.","transport packet, transport segmentation policy, adjusting transport segmentation policy, lower layer, delay-tolerant network architecture, various layer, transport adaptation scheme, protocol data unit, delay-tolerant network, dtn bundle protocol, dtn protocol, file delivery time, transport packet size, interplanetary networking, space internetworking, dtn bundle, delay tolerant network, heuristic search"
The impact sensitivity of some groups of nitrates and cubane derivatives has been correlated with their heat of explosion and chemical structure. These correlations show the ways of reducing explosion hazard in handling these compounds. It is currently impossible to construct a reference series of compounds that would allow explosives with preset sensitivity to be synthesized on the basis of a preliminary energetic prediction. New opportunities to enhance safety in handling explosives can be provided by investigating their detonation ability.,"explosives, impact sensitivity, energetic approach, detonation ability"
"Th2 cell differentiation involves complex changes in expression of multiple genes, many of which have poorly characterized roles. In a gene expression microarray analysis of human primary CD4 effector T subsets, we identified that an adaptor protein, GAB2, was preferentially expressed in human Th2 cells. The role of GAB2 in human Th2 cells is unknown. Through analysis of primary and in vitro differentiated human T effector subsets, we confirmed that human Th2 cells preferentially expressed GAB2. Further analysis of public gene expression microarray data of STAT6-knockdowned Th2 cells indicated that GAB2 expression was regulated by IL-4 and STAT6. Both siRNA knockdown and ectopic expression of GAB2 in activated T cells showed that GAB2 positively regulated IL-4 and IL-13 expression in human Th2 cells. We hence identified the adaptor protein, GAB2, as an important novel regulator of the human Th2 immune response.","Differentiation, GAB2, Immune response, T helper 2 cells"
"Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) have been identified as the predominant anesthesia providers in rural areas; however, little information is available about the types of services provided by rural CRNAs. The purposes of this study were to pilot test the Nurse Anesthesia Rural Practice Inventory (NARPI); determine whether CRNAs can provide the requested data; and provide data about characteristics of rural nurse anesthesia practice. The NARPI is a newly developed, self-administered questionnaire containing 39 items related to anesthesia practice. The survey was mailed to a stratified convenience sample of 146 actively practicing CRNAs living in rural areas. Of the 33 surveys returned (23%), 28 were usable for data analysis with descriptive statistics. The findings revealed that rural CRNAs provide a broad range of anesthesia and anesthesia-related services within and outside the operating room and support the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists' statement that CRNAs are the predominant anesthesia providers in rural areas. Significant differences were found in the employment settings of independent and medically directed CRNAs, the availability of certain anesthetic agents and monitoring devices, and the representation of surgical specialists based on community and hospital size. The NARPI has the potential to provide needed information about rural anesthesia practice in future studies.","nurse anesthetist, rural., anesthesia manpower, service provider, data analysis, rural area"
"The patient with febrile rash poses a real diagnostic challenge to primary care physician. We report an original case of febrile macular rash whose etiology was related to sepsis secondary to pelviperitonitis and acute cholecystitis. Patient's history, careful physical examination, paraclinical examinations and favorable outcome allowed to retain the infectious origin of the rash, without microbiological confirmation in our study. The skin is an excellent marker for infection. Cutaneous manifestations are the most common signs observed in patients with sepsis at an early stage. Exanthema is the most common lesion; it is due to systemic effects of a microorganism infecting the skin. If there are no clinical signs of infection, early diagnosis can prevent complications.","Exanthema, early diagnosis, fever, toxins"
"We use the term component-based software deployment (CBSD) to refer to the process of deploying a software application in a component-based format. In this paper, we propose a formal conceptual framework for CBSD. This framework allows us to articulate various strategies for deploying component-based software. In addition, the framework permits us to express conditions under which various forms of component -based software deployment are both successful (the deployed application works) and safe (no existing applications are damaged).","software deployment, component-based software engineering, component-based software deployment, software installation, conceptual foundation, conceptual framework, component based software engineering"
"Although microorganisms are traditionally used to investigate unicellular processes, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has the ability to form colonies with highly complex, multicellular structures. Colonies with the ""fluffy"" morphology have properties reminiscent of bacterial biofilms and are easily distinguished from the ""smooth"" colonies typically formed by laboratory strains. We have identified strains that are able to reversibly toggle between the fluffy and smooth colony-forming states. Using a combination of flow cytometry and high-throughput restriction-site associated DNA tag sequencing, we show that this switch is correlated with a change in chromosomal copy number. Furthermore, the gain of a single chromosome is sufficient to switch a strain from the fluffy to the smooth state, and its subsequent loss to revert the strain back to the fluffy state. Because copy number imbalance of six of the 16 S. cerevisiae chromosomes and even a single gene can modulate the switch, our results support the hypothesis that the state switch is produced by dosage-sensitive genes, rather than a general response to altered DNA content. These findings add a complex, multicellular phenotype to the list of molecular and cellular traits known to be altered by aneuploidy and suggest that chromosome missegregation can provide a quick, heritable, and reversible mechanism by which organisms can toggle between phenotypes.","bet-hedging, colony morphology, copy number variation, phenotypic switching, gene dosage, phenotype"
"Small-conductance, Ca(2+) -activated K(+) (SK) channels are expressed in the hippocampus where they regulate synaptic responses, plasticity, and learning and memory. To investigate the expression of SK3 (KCNN3) subunits, we determined the developmental profile and subcellular distribution of SK3 in the developing mouse hippocampus using western blots, immunohistochemistry and high-resolution immunoelectron microscopy. The results showed that SK3 expression increased during postnatal development, and that the localization of SK3 changed from being mainly associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and intracellular sites during the first postnatal week to being progressively concentrated in dendritic spines during later stages. In the adult, SK3 was localized mainly in postsynaptic compartments, both at extrasynaptic sites and along the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. Double labelling showed that SK3 co-localized with SK2 (KCNN2) and with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Finally, quantitative analysis of SK3 density revealed two subcellular distribution patterns in different hippocampal layers, with SK3 being unevenly distributed in CA1 region of the hippocampus pyramidal cells and homogeneously distributed in dentate gyrus granule cells. Our results revealed a complex cell surface distribution of SK3-containing channels and a distinct developmental program that may influence different hippocampal functions.","cell surface distribution, development, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, mouse, potassium channel"
"Despite the increasing popularity of viral marketing, factors critical to such a new communication medium remain largely unknown. This paper examines one of the critical factors, namely Internet users' motivations to pass along online content. Conceptualizing the act of forwarding online content as a special case of a more general communication behavior, we identify four potential motivations: (1) the need to be part of a group, (2) the need to be individualistic, (3) the need to be altruistic, and (4) the need for personal growth. Using a survey of young adults, we examine the relationship between these motivations and the frequency of passing along online content. We also investigate if high trait curiosity can indirectly lead to more forwarding by increasing the amount of online content consumed. Results show that Internet users, who are more individualistic and/or more altruistic, tend to forward more online content than others.","electronic word-of-mouth (e-wom), e-maven, motivation, viral marketing, young adult, word of mouth"
"Bio-medical knowledge bases are valuable resources for the research community. Original scientific publications are the main source used to annotate them. Medical annotation in Swiss-Prot is specifically targeted at finding and extracting data about human genetic diseases and polymorphisms. Curators have to scan through hundreds of publications to select the relevant ones. This workload can be greatly reduced by using bio-text mining techniques. Using a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and statistical classifiers, we achieve recall points of up to 84% on the potentially interesting documents and a precision of more than 96% in detecting irrelevant documents. Careful analysis of the document pre-processing chain allows us to measure the impact of some steps on the overall result, as well as test different classifier configurations. The best combination was used to create a prototype of a search and classification tool that is currently tested by the database curators.","swiss prot, natural language processing, knowledge base, polymorphism, human genetics, text mining"
"The stego image quality produced by the histogram-shifting based reversible data hiding technique is high; however, it often suffers from lower embedding capacity compared to other types of reversible data hiding techniques. In 2009, Tsai et al. solved this problem by exploiting the similarity of neighboring pixels to construct a histogram of prediction errors; data embedding is done by shifting the error histogram. However, Tsai et al.'s method does not fully exploit the correlation of the neighboring pixels. In this paper, a set of basic pixels is employed to improve the prediction accuracy, thereby increasing the payload. To further improve the image quality, a threshold is used to select only low-variance blocks to join the embedding process. According to the experimental results, the proposed method provides a better or comparable stego image quality than Tsai et al.'s method and other existing reversible data hiding methods under the same payload.","prediction, reversible data, image quality, comparable stego image quality, data embedding, reversible data hiding, local variance-controlled reversible data, existing reversible data, histogram-shifting, lower embedding capacity, embedding process, stego image quality, neighboring pixel, prediction error"
"Confidence in answers is known to be sensitive to the fluency with which answers come to mind. One aspect of fluency is response latency. Latency is often a valid cue for accuracy, showing an inverse relationship with both accuracy rates and confidence. The present study examined the independent latency-confidence association in problem-solving tasks. The tasks were ecologically valid situations in which latency showed no validity, moderate validity, and high validity as a predictor of accuracy. In Experiment 1, misleading problems, which often elicit initial wrong solutions, were answered in open-ended and multiple-choice test formats. Under the open-ended test format, latency was absolutely not valid in predicting accuracy: Quickly and slowly provided solutions had a similar chance of being correct. Under the multiple-choice test format, latency predicted accuracy better. In Experiment 2, nonmisleading problems were used; here, latency was highly valid in predicting accuracy. A breakdown into correct and incorrect solutions allowed examination of the independent latency-confidence relationship when latency necessarily had no validity in predicting accuracy. In all conditions, regardless of latency's validity in predicting accuracy, confidence was persistently sensitive to latency: The participants were more confident in solutions provided quickly than in those that involved lengthy thinking. The study suggests that the reliability of the latency-confidence association in problem solving depends on the strength of the inverse relationship between latency and accuracy in the particular task.","High order cognition, Metamemory, Reaction time analysis, Fluency"
"This study characterized and compared Veterans of the United States Armed Forces with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to Veterans with no mental health disorders on self-reported measures of factors that influence success in weight management programs.We examined the relation of PTSD diagnosis with weight loss plan, reasons for overweight/obesity and barriers to dieting and physical exercise among 171,884 Veterans. Statistically significant variables in chi-square tests (P<.05) with at least a small effect size were then compared via multivariate logistic regression analyses.Both groups reported high ratings of importance and confidence regarding changing weight loss behaviors and were preparing or actively engaging in efforts to manage their weight. Compared to Veterans without mental health disorders, more Veterans with PTSD endorsed 27 of the 28 barriers to changing eating and physical habits.The results of this study help to explain the lower rates of success of Veterans with PTSD in weight loss programs. Results suggest that a comprehensive, integrated approach to promoting weight loss in Veterans with PTSD is needed.","MOVE!, Post-traumatic stress disorder, Veterans, Weight management"
"To determine whether isolated eardrum perforation is a marker for concealed blast lung injury in survivors of terrorist bombings.Survivors who arrived at hospitals after 11 terrorist bombings in Israel between April 6, 1994, and March 4, 1996, were examined otoscopically by ear, nose, and throat specialists. All patients with eardrum perforation underwent chest radiography and were hospitalized for at least 24 hours for observation. The clinical course and final outcome of patients with isolated perforation of the eardrums and of those with other blast injuries were surveyed.A total of 647 survivors were examined; 193 (29.8%) of them sustained primary blast injuries, including 142 with isolated eardrum perforation and 51 with other forms of blast injuries (18 with isolated pulmonary blast injury, 31 with combined otic and pulmonary injuries, and 2 with intestinal blast injury). Blast lung injury was promptly diagnosed on admission by physical examination and chest radiography. No patient presenting with isolated eardrum perforation developed later signs of pulmonary or intestinal blast injury (mean 0%; 95% confidence interval, 0% to 2.7%).Isolated eardrum perforation in survivors of explosions does not appear to be a marker of concealed pulmonary blast injury nor of a poor prognosis. Therefore, in a mass casualty event, persons who have sustained isolated eardrum perforation from explosions may safely be discharged from the emergency department after chest radiography and a brief observation period.","suicide prevention, human factors, injury prevention, confidence interval, physical examination, ergonomics, occupational safety"
"The Fuglebekken basin is situated in the southern part of the island of Spitsbergen (Norwegian Arctic), on the Hornsund fjord (Wedel Jarlsberg Land). Surface water was collected from 24 tributaries (B1-B24) and from the main stream water in the Fuglebekken basin (25) between 10 July 2009 and 30 July 2009. The present investigation reveals the results of the analysis of these samples for their PAH and PCB content. Twelve of 16 PAHs and seven PCBs were determined in the surface waters from 24 tributaries and the main stream. Total PAH and PCB concentrations in the surface waters ranged from 4 to 600 ng/L and from 2 to 400 ng/L respectively. The highest concentrations of an individual PCB (138-308 ng/L and 123 ng/L) were found in samples from tributaries B9 and B5. The presence in the basin (thousands of kilometres distant from industrial centres) of PAHs and PCBs is testimony to the fact that these compounds are transported over vast distances with air masses and deposited in regions devoid of any human pressure.","fuglebekken basin, norwegian arctic, svalbard, polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, surface waters, sensors"
"Histochemical visualization of catecholamines and electron microscopy in the same tissue sample were used to localize and study catecholamine-containing nerve enlargements or swellings in male Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rat kidneys. These swellings lie in the perivascular nerve plexuses of arcuate and interlobular arteries near the points of origin of arterioles, and are composed of modified axons and associated Schwann cells. Transverse sections of the enlarged nerves reveal that individual axons are also enlarged, have processes or folds and make contact with one another. The axonal enlargements contain small mitochondria with a dense matrix and clusters of small vesicles, many of which are associated with an organelle composed of parallel cisternae of smooth membranes.","mechanoreceptor, catecholamine, kidney, innervation"
"Several allergen-sampling methods are used to assess level of personal or indirect exposure to cat in homes, schools and other public buildings and working environments.To compare four different allergen-sampling methods (dust collectors, Petri dishes, person-carried pumps and intranasal samplers) by simultaneous sampling in classrooms and to compare the cat allergen levels between conventional classrooms and allergy prevention classrooms. Another aim was to relate the results to self-reported frequency of allergy and asthma symptoms among the children, to their perception of the school environment.Among all compulsory schools (n = 257) in the Stockholm suburban area, 35 classrooms (five with implemented allergy prevention measures, seven with additional cleaning and 23 with normal cleaning routines) were chosen for allergen-sampling. Dust collectors (two models), Petri dishes, person-carried pumps and intranasal samplers were used simultaneously. All children (n = 829) received a self-administered questionnaire which included questions about home and school environment, allergic disease, asthma symptoms and pet contact.The correlation between sampling methods was generally poor.Furthermore, there was no significant difference in allergen levels between allergy prevention and allergen avoidance classes compared to conventional classes. Median levels were generally, but not significantly, lower in classes with few cat owners, compared to classes with many cat owners. Children in allergy prevention classes were more satisfied with the indoor air quality and cleaning than children attending classes with fewer or no allergy prevention measures (P < 0.0001). Nine per cent of all children reported allergic symptoms while at school.The lack of correlation between sampling methods used simultaneously demonstrates the difficulty in assessing allergen levels in schools and similar environments. The implemented intervention measures (allergy prevention/allergen avoidance) did not influence cat allergen levels at school.","prevention, petri dish, sampling, sampling methods"
"The tegumental ultrastructure of juvenile and adult Himasthla alincia (Digenea: Echinostomatidae) was observed by scanning electron microscopy. One-, 5- (juveniles) and 20-day-old worms (adults) were harvested from chicks experimentally fed metacercariae from a bivalve, Mactra veneriformis. The juvenile worms were elongated and curved ventrally. The head crown bore 31 collar spines, arranged in a single row. The lip of the oral sucker had 12 paired, and 3 single type I sensory papillae, and the ventral sucker had about 25 type II sensory papillae. The anterolateral surface between the two suckers was densely packed with tegumental spines with 4-7 pointed tips. The adult worms were more elongated and filamentous, and had severe transverse folds over the whole body surface. On the head crown and two suckers, type I and II sensory papillae were more densely distributed than in the juvenile worms. Retractile brush-like spines, with 8-10 digits, were seen on the anterolateral surface, whereas claw-shaped spines, with 2-5 digits, were sparsely distributed posteriorly to the ventral sucker. The cirrus characteristically protruded out, and was armed with small spines distally. The surface ultrastructure of H. alincia was shown to be unique among echinostomes, especially in the digitation of its tegumental spines, the distribution of sensory papillae and by severe folds of the tegument.","tegument, aging, sense organs, integumentary system"

"The activities of glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II and the concentration of methylglyoxal were determined in 26 human lenses. The activity of glyoxalase I (mean +/- S.D.) was 15.62 +/- 3.90 U (g wet weight)-1 and the activity of glyoxalase II was 0.189 +/- 0.087 U (g wet weight)-1 (n = 26). The concentration of methylglyoxal of the human lenses was 1.78 +/- 0.84 nmol (g wet weight)-1 (n = 26). There was a significant negative correlation of both the activity of glyoxalase I and the activity of glyoxalase II with subject age but no correlation of methylglyoxal concentration with subject age. The concentration of methylglyoxal in the lenses was approximately 20-fold higher than in blood samples from normal human subjects. Given the previously reported decrease in the concentration of reduced glutathione in the human lens with age, there is expected to be a marked decrease in in situ activity of glyoxalase I and concomitant susceptibility of human lens proteins to modification by methylglyoxal with age. The metabolism of methylglyoxal and the formation of methylglyoxal-modified proteins may be linked to the development of senile and diabetic cataract.","human lens, glyoxalase, methylglyoxal, age, glutathione, cataract"
"Interleukin 1 (IL-1), present in high amounts in normal human skin without any sign of inflammation, suggests a complex mechanism by which its bioactivity is regulated. The specific receptor antagonist of IL-1 (IL-1ra) was analyzed in human skin, sweat and cultured keratinocytes. Extracts of both skin and cultured keratinocytes blocked the binding of [125I]IL-1 to its receptor whereas sweat did not. The inhibitory activity was cell-associated, was not secreted by cultured keratinocytes, and IL-1ra mRNA was identified in these cells. There was an inverse relationship between the level of IL-1ra and that of IL-1 alpha and beta since extracts of differentiating keratinocytes (DK) and higher IL-1ra levels and expressed more mRNA for IL-1ra than non-differentiated keratinocytes (NDK), whereas NDK contained 4 times more IL-1 alpha and beta proteins than DK. This association of cell differentiation with a shift in agonist/antagonist ratio might be related to important autocrine or paracrine functions of IL-1 in normal and inflamed human skin.","interleukin-1, keratinocyte, human epidermis, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, interleukin 1, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist"
"To examine the consequences for measurement of child psychiatric disorder (conduct and oppositional disorders) of not integrating the data on the same individual from different informants compared with integrating the information from parents and teachers, using three different strategies.Data for the study came from problem checklist assessments done by parents and teachers of children aged 6 to 16 years (N = 1,134) selected with known probability from a general population sample and from structured interviews obtained in a stratified random subsample (n = 251).As expected, parent-teacher agreement was low. The pattern of associated features of disorder was found to vary markedly in parent-identified compared with teacher-identified disorder. Furthermore, combining informants had the disadvantage of masking the distinctive patterns of associated features noted in informant-specific disorders. Finally, by treating disorder as informant-specific, the internal properties of the measure are not generally inferior to those obtained by combining informants in various ways.Child psychiatric disorders should be conceptualized as informant-specific phenomena.","classification, epidemiology, childhood disorder, informants"
"Anticipatory scheduling (AS) of I/O requests has become a viable choice for block-device schedulers in open-source OS-kernels as prior work has established its superiority over traditional disk-scheduling policies. An AS-scheduler selectively stalls the block-device right after servicing a request in hope that a new request for a nearby sector will be soon posted. Clearly, this decision may introduce delays if the anticipated I/O does not arrive on time. In this paper, we build on the success of the AS and propose an approach that minimizes the overhead of unsuccessful anticipations. Our suggested approach termed workload-dependent anticipation scheduling (WAS), determines the length of every anticipation period in an on-line fashion in order to reduce penalties by taking into account the evolving spatio-temporal characteristics of running processes as well as properties of the underlying computing system. We harvest the spatio-temporal features of individual processes and employ a system-wide process classification scheme that is re-calibrated on the fly. The resulting classification enables the disk scheduler to make informed decisions and vary the anticipation interval accordingly, on a per-process basis. We have implemented and incorporated WAS into the current Linux kernel. Through experimentation with a wide range of diverse workloads, we demonstrate WAS benefits and establish reduction of penalties over other AS-scheduler implementations.","block-device right, anticipation period, unsuccessful anticipation, kernel structures, workload-dependent anticipation scheduling, adaptive disk scheduling, workload-dependent anticipation interval, anticipatory scheduling, anticipation interval, as-scheduler implementation, new request, scheduling of block-devices, o request, block-device schedulers, disk scheduling"
"The Internet is susceptible to congestion due to progressively increasing traffic as well as short-lived traffic surges. Traditional mechanisms to counter these effects over-provision the IP network to a significant degree. At the same time, the advent of dynamic circuits in L2/L1 networks has fueled the research in the area of network engineering which deals with the ability to add capacity in the higher layer (IP) by establishing dynamic circuits in the lower layers. However, effective usage of dynamic circuits is a challenge, as they can lead to IP routing instabilities. We present an approach wherein IP bypass links are established using dynamic circuits to alleviate congestion while keeping the routing stable in the IP layer. Proposed is an ILP based approach which computes the optimal set of circuits with and without the knowledge of the traffic matrix in the IP layer. The results show that even without the knowledge of the traffic matrix, the proposed method computes only a marginally higher number of bypasses, albeit at a higher capacity.","switches, routing, internet, ip routing, network topology"
"About 285 million people are visually impaired around the world. In the United States, this number is over 1.3 million, which represents 0.4% of the population. However, the cost is about 4 billion dollars a year to build infrastructures and provide proper health care to meet the needs of these people. This paper proposes a system that would help the visually impaired adapt to the environment rather than trying to adapt the environment to them. The development of this system will enable the visually impaired to maintain efficient daily activities in many different environments. This system uses multiple sensors and analyzes the information acquired in real-time. In this paper, we particularly emphasize image processing to provide effective obstacle avoidance, object recognition and 3D reconstruction of the environment.","assisted living, collision avoidance, data acquisition, handicapped aids, image reconstruction, image sensors, object recognition, 3d image reconstruction, daily activity maintenance, health care, image processing, image sensing system, information acquisition, obstacle avoidance, visually impaired people navigation"

"Abstract Ninety-two sexually abused children were studied using structured interviews and standardized instruments to determine the frequency of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and associated symptoms. Of these sexually abused children, 43.9% met DSM-III -R PTSD criteria; 53.8% of children abused by fathers, 42.4% abused by trusted adults, and 10% of those abused by strangers met criteria as opposed to none of the children abused by an older child. No relationship was observed between the time lapsed since last abusive episode and the presence of PTSD. Many children not meeting full criteria exhibited partial PTSD symptoms. Only one standardized instrument (Child Behavior Checklist) detected group differences with PTSD children exhibiting more symptoms. This study replicates an earlier pilot study and underscores the need for further PTSD research.","high-risk study, sexually abused children, sex abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, injury prevention, human factors, ergonomics, occupational safety, suicide prevention"

"The perioperative care, morbidity, and mortality in 30 patients with mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) are presented. They underwent a detailed preoperative assessment and were anesthetized 141 times. An intravenous induction technique was used in most patients. It was easier to see the vocal cords, during laryngoscopy, in children with Hurler syndrome (HS) when they were younger (23 v 41 months, P < or = .01) and smaller (12 v 15 kg, P < or = .05). Preoperative obstructive breathing was associated with a significantly higher incidence of postextubation obstruction (P < or = .05). A total of 28 children underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT); this reversed upper airway obstruction and also reversed intracranial hypertension. In children with HS, the incidence of odontoid dysplasia was 94%; 38% demonstrated anterior C1-C2 subluxation. Head and neck manipulation was limited in children with cervical spine defects. None of the 30 patients experienced spinal cord morbidity. One child suffered an intraoperative stroke; another, pulmonary edema. Severe and extensive coronary obstruction was responsible for 2 intraoperative deaths.

"This paper examines the relative role of relationships in shaping business satisfaction with, and commitment to, a business location. Economic and social exchange provides the theoretical perspectives for this study. In particular, this paper addresses the question: is social exchange valued in its own right (as a separate element alongside economic benefits) or does it rather add value to the economic exchange process? That is, is social exchange a benefit, or is it a facilitating condition? These issues are tested using path analysis with data from a survey among executives of manufacturing firms located in a 10-county area of the southeastern United States. The results support a model wherein social exchange facilitates the relationship between location factors (in particular, transportation access, labor quality, and government support) and location satisfaction.","path analysis, economic development, economic exchange, social exchange, empirical study"
"An effective Hamiltonian technique is used to investigate the effect of applying curled electric fields on physical properties of stress-free BiFeO(3) dots being under open-circuit electrical boundary conditions. It is discovered that such fields can lead to a control of not only the magnitude but also the direction of the magnetization. Such control originates from the field-induced transformation or switching of electrical vortices and their couplings with oxygen octahedral tilts and magnetic dipoles. This control involves striking intermediate states and constitutes a novel phenomenon that can be termed a ""magnetotoroidic"" effect.","electric field, numerical simulation, molecular dynamic, physical properties, boundary condition"
"Congenital high airway obstruction syndrome (CHAOS) results in a predictable constellation of findings: large echogenic lungs, flattened or inverted diaphragms, dilated airways distal to the obstruction, and fetal ascites and/or hydrops. The authors report on four fetuses referred for evaluation. None of them survived. Postmortem evaluation showed that three fetuses had laryngeal atresia, and one had tracheal stenosis. Coexistent fetal anomalies were accurately diagnosed by ultrasound in three of the four patients. The finding of CHAOS on prenatal ultrasound examination is diagnostic of complete or near-complete obstruction of the fetal upper airway, most likely caused by laryngeal atresia. A greater understanding of the natural history of CHAOS may permit improved prenatal and perinatal management.","fetal hydrops, fetal surgery, tracheal stenosis, fraser syndrome, laryngeal atresia"
"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used for the design of composite and non-composite steel floor systems. The design problem is the minimization of the mass or the cost of a steel floor configuration subject to constraints related to the Canadian S16 design standard.

Outputs returned are the girder and beams sizes, steel deck profile, concrete slab thickness, number of interior beams and the number of steel studs needed per beam. Results show the PSO can consistently find the optimum floor configuration by minimizing the total mass or cost while satisfying all design criteria.","composite floors, evolutionary algorithms, steel floor systems, building design, structural optimization, particle swarm optimization, evolutionary algorithm, satisfiability"

Here, we show that an intimate interaction between backbone amides also arises from the delocalization of a lone pair of electrons (n) from an oxygen atom to the antibonding orbital (pi*) of the subsequent carbonyl group. Natural bond orbital analysis predicted significant n-->pi* interactions in certain regions of the Ramachandran plot. These predictions were validated by a statistical analysis of a large, non-redundant subset of protein structures determined to high resolution. The correlation between these two independent studies is striking. Moreover, the n-->pi* interactions are abundant and especially prevalent in common secondary structures such as alpha-, 3(10)- and polyproline II helices and twisted beta-sheets. In addition to their evident effects on protein structure and stability, n-->pi* interactions could have important roles in protein folding and function, and merit inclusion in computational force fields.","protein conformation, hydrogen bonding, computational biology, proteins"
"In this paper, a multi-layered model is developed and the plane elasticity problem for a functionally graded strip containing a crack has been considered by using this model. By utilizing the Fourier transformation technique and the transfer matrix method, the mixed boundary problem is reduced to a system of singular integral equations that are solved numerically. The influences of the graded variation of material parameters and geometric parameters on the stress intensity factors are investigated. The numerical results show that the graded variation of material parameter has significant effects on the stress intensity factors.","Crack, Functionally graded materials, Multi-layered model, Stress intensity factors"
"Aminophosphonic acids analogous to glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine, and valine were actively accumulated by Lactobacillus plantarum. Uptake was dependent on the availability of glucose and, in all cases, the estimated intracellular concentrations substantially exceeded extracellular levels. During uptake, there was little metabolism of tritiated 2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (APP), the aspartic acid analogue, and a negligible incorporation of isotope from this substance into the nucleic acid, lipid, protein, or cell wall fractions of the cell. Competition studies with APP indicated that its transport in L. plantarum and in Streptococcus faecalis was antagonized only by structurally related compounds such as glutamic, aspartic, and cysteic acids. Kinetic studies showed that APP was taken up by a single catalytic system in S. faecalis. A mutant strain of this organism which lacks one of two kinetically distinguishable dicarboxylic amino acid transport systems failed to accumulate measurable amounts of APP. These experiments indicate that the aminophosphonic acids are accumulated by the amino acid transport systems in these bacteria with minimal metabolic changes.","amino acids, chromatography paper, tritium, electrophoresis"
"For iterative mean-square error (MSE) quantizers with alphabet size M=2K using low-density generator-matrix (LDGM) code constructions, an efficient recovery algorithm is proposed, which adjusts the priors used in belief propagation (BP) to limit the impact of previous non-ideal decimation steps. Based on an analysis of the BP process under ideal or non-ideal decimation, the algorithm first estimates the conditional probability distributions describing the effect of non-ideal decimation, then adjusts the priors to make the distributions match the ideal situation. As shown in simulation results, the recovery algorithm can improve quantization performance greatly, reducing the shaping loss to as low as 0.012 dB, while the increase in computational complexity is modest thanks to the use of FFT techniques.","iterative mean-square error quantizer, fft technique, statistical distributions, belief propagation, near-ideal m-ary ldgm quantization, quantization, quantisation (signal), decimation, recovery, computational complexity, non-ideal decimation steps, low-density generator-matrix code, low-density generator-matrix, conditional probability distribution, recovery algorithm, markov processes, approximation algorithms, algorithm design and analysis, markov process, channel coding, algorithm design"
"This study investigated recall in a sample of depressed, anxious, and normal children followed up as adults. Strengths of this study were that the length of the retest interval was substantial, follow-up information was collected by blind interviewers, and childhood diagnoses were clearly documented.The sample consisted of 144 subjects with a childhood diagnosis of depression, 48 with a childhood diagnosis of anxiety, and 128 normal controls. Best-estimate diagnoses assigned at follow-up were compared with childhood primary diagnoses.Reliability and sensitivity were fair for major depressive disorder (mean = 0.46 and 50%, respectively) and any depression (mean = 0.57 and 65%, respectively). Reliability and sensitivity were relatively lower for anxiety (mean = 0.32 and 43%, respectively). Sensitivity for any diagnosis was good (mean = 71%). Specificity was good among all diagnostic categories (range = 73%-100%). Results suggest better diagnostic recall for females than for males. Recall was slightly better for subjects who were older than age 12 during their original episode. Age-of-onset reliability was poor (major depressive disorder = 0.22, any depression = 0.22, and any anxiety = -0.13).Recall of any childhood disorder is moderately reliable and accurate. Recall of a specific disorder is less accurate. Depression was more likely to be recalled than anxiety. High specificity suggests that participants were not biased to report disorders not present in childhood.","sensitivity, recall, specificity, reliability, best-estimate diagnoses"
"An extensive parametric study on the inelastic seismic response of plane steel moment resisting frames (MRF) with setbacks is presented. A family of 120 such frames, designed according to the European seismic and structural codes, are subjected to an ensemble of 30 ordinary (i.e. without near-fault effects) earthquake ground motions scaled to different intensities in order to drive the structures to different limit states. The statistical analysis of the created response databank indicates that the number of stories, beam-to-column strength ratio, geometrical irregularity and limit state under consideration strongly influence the heightwise distribution and amplitude of inelastic deformation demands. Nonlinear regression analysis is employed in order to derive simple formulae which reflect the aforementioned influences and offer, for a given strength reduction (or behaviour) factor, three important response quantities, i.e. the maximum roof displacement, the maximum interstorey drift ratio and the maximum rotation ductility along the height of the structure. A comparison of the proposed method with the procedures adopted in current seismic design codes reveals the accuracy and efficiency of the former.","vertical irregularity, steel mrf, seismic design, deformation demands, seismic assessment, setbacks, statistical analysis, nonlinear regression"
"Selecting an effective form of management control in sales organizations is important in achieving favorable salesperson consequences. We examine an alternative perspective to behavior-based management control in sales organizations. The conceptualization consisting of high, bureaucratic, clan, and low management control combinations is examined as a framework for management control research in sales organizations. In this study, hypotheses are developed concerning various salesperson consequences of the control combinations. The hypotheses are tested using a sample of 1042 salespeople from a broad range of industries and companies. The findings suggest that salespeople who work under a more visible control system (high control) perform better, are more satisfied, and display lower burnout and role stress, compared to salespeople working under bureaucratic, clan, and low control combinations. The managerial implications are discussed and several future research directions are proposed.","salesperson control consequences, sales management control, control system, management control, satisfiability, information management"
"Postoperative portable chest films are routinely performed after fluoroscopic placement of central venous catheters to evaluate positioning and to rule out significant complications (eg, pneumothorax). Emerging evidence in the literature has called this practice into question suggesting that routine postoperative chest x-ray is unnecessary. Therefore, we investigated our recent experience to examine the utility of these films, to examine the development of symptoms relative to therapeutic intervention, and to report a cost-benefit analysis.After obtaining institutional review board approval, all charts of patients undergoing central venous catheter placement from January 2004 to December 2005 at our institution were reviewed. Outcome measures included whether or not there was a complication and whether or not that complication required an intervention. Peripherally inserted central catheters were not included.In the study population, 237 catheters were placed in the operating room. There were two complications, both pneumothoraces (0.085%). One patient required tube thoracostomy, whereas the other was asymptomatic and the pneumothorax resolved spontaneously. Fourteen patients had no postoperative chest film without adverse consequences. Total cost for portable chest films was $56,196.For catheters placed under fluoroscopic guidance, postoperative chest films in asymptomatic patients add unnecessary cost. For this reason, we feel discontinuation of postoperative chest films in asymptomatic patients undergoing catheter placement with fluoroscopy is justifiable.","fluoroscopy, central venous catheter, chest x-ray, central line placement, retrospective studies, cost benefit analysis"
"Distribution networks are evolving toward the vision of smart grids, with increasing penetration of distributed generation (DG), introduction of active network management (ANM), and potentially islanded modes of operation. These changes affect fault levels and fault current paths and have been demonstrated to compromise the correct operation of the overcurrent protection system. This paper presents an adaptive overcurrent protection system which automatically amends the protection settings of all overcurrent relays in response to the impact of DG, ANM, and islanding operation. The scheme has been developed using commercially available protection devices, employs IEC61850-based communications, and has been demonstrated and tested using a hardware-in-the-loop laboratory facility. A systematic comparison of the performance of the proposed adaptive scheme alongside that of a conventional overcurrent scheme is presented. This comparison quantifies the decrease in false operations and the reduction of mean operating time that the adaptive system offers.","Adaptive systems, Optical character recognition software, Fault currents, Circuit faults, Circuit breakers, Relays, Network topology"
"Most research on plant-plant chemical interactions has focussed on events following herbivore or pathogen attack. However, undamaged plants also interact chemically as a natural facet of their behaviour, and this may have consequences for insects that use the plants as hosts. In this review, the links between allelopathy and insect behaviour are outlined. Findings on how chemical interactions between different plant species and genotypes affect aphid herbivores and their natural enemies are reviewed, and the role of plant diversity and chemical interaction for trophic interactions in crops is discussed.","aphids, tritrophic interaction, allelopathy, allelobiosis, ladybirds"
"Steel building frames are often analyzed for stability in an elastic way, while most of their columns behave inelastically at the buckling stage. Most column design provisions allow for inelastic behavior, but overall inelastic stability analysis is rarely performed. In this study the analysis philosophy is centered on the overall frame stability and its true safety factor. As many columns show inelastic behavior at the buckling stage, the proposed procedure takes due consideration of this fact. Once the overall buckling factor for the frame is obtained, individual column effective length factors, and their true slenderness ratios are computed, and used in the design relationships. This procedure circumvents the use of design nomographs and numerous formulas proposed in the past to alleviate their shortcomings. The procedure proposed based on the overall safety factor concept is an iterative one. It starts with a stability analysis and gradually modifies the structural properties to take account of inelasticity and eventually converges to the final buckling factor and mode shape. Any type of lateral restraint can be exactly modeled and taken into consideration without the need for approximate simplifying assumptions. The design philosophy proposed herein is that all columns must have their design parameters as related to buckling capacity must be derived from a single buckling analysis valid for the whole structure, and not considered separately and isolated from the rest of the structure as is currently practiced. Examples are worked out to illustrate the procedure and the results are compared to those of others.","steel frame stability, effective column lengths, effective modulus, aisc code, residual stresses, inelastic buckling, stability analysis, residual stress, safety factor"
"This study was undertaken to assess results of surgery for fistula-in-ano and identify risk factors for fistula recurrence and impaired continence.We reviewed the records of 624 patients who underwent surgery for fistula-in-ano between 1988 and 1992. Follow-up was by mailed questionnaire, with 375 patients (60 percent) responding. Mean follow-up was 29 months. Fistulas were intersphincteric in 180 patients, transsphincteric in 108, suprasphincteric in 6, extrasphincteric in 6, and unclassified in 75. Procedures included fistulotomy and marsupialization (n = 300), seton placement (n = 63), endorectal advancement flap (n = 3), and other (n = 9). Factors associated with recurrence and incontinence were analyzed by univariate and multivariate regression analysis.The fistula recurred in 31 patients (8 percent), and 45 percent complained of some degree of postoperative incontinence. Factors associated with recurrence included complex type of fistula, horseshoe extension, lack of identification or lateral location of the internal fistulous opening, previous fistula surgery, and the surgeon performing the procedure. Incontinence was associated with female sex, high anal fistula, type of surgery, and previous fistula surgery.Surgical treatment of fistula-in-ano is associated with a significant risk of recurrence and a high risk of impaired continence. Degree of risk varies with identifiable factors.","treatment, complication, risk factor, surgery"

Subsequently, Ss received lesions in the septum or anterior sigmoid gyrus or remained as normal controls. Postoperatively, Ss were retested on all preoperative tasks and also on passive-avoidance, serial reversal, delayed-alternation, and searching tasks. The anterior sigmoid group was impaired in relearning a BLACK-WHITE discrimination. Both the frontal and septal groups were more active than controls in the open field and also were impaired on the last 100 trials of delayed alternation. No differences were observed among the groups in the remainder of the tasks.

"<p>Overconsolidated unsaturated soils emerge in many engineering problems. This article presents a constitutive model for unsaturated soils using skeleton stress and degree of saturation as fundamental variables. A subloading surface is introduced into the framework to interpret the effect of overconsolidation on the coupled hydromechanical behavior of overconsolidated unsaturated soils. The main advantage of the proposed model is that it is capable of reproducing the hydromechanical behavior of unsaturated soils with different initial overconsolidation ratios, such as the overconsolidation effect on the shearing-induced saturation change. The material parameters of the proposed model can be calibrated through conventional tests. Numerical studies were conducted to assess the performance of the model for a fictional silt under two typical scenarios. The validity of the proposed model was confirmed by experimental results for both isotropic and triaxial conditions reported in the literature.</p>","Soil properties, Unsaturated soils, Overconsolidated soils, Numerical analysis, Constitutive relations, Hydromechanics, Hydrologic models, Soil stress"
"The progressive collapse resistance of seismically designed steel braced frames is investigated using validated computational simulation models. Two types of braced systems are considered: namely, special concentrically braced frames and eccentrically braced frames. The study is conducted on previously designed 10-story prototype buildings by applying the alternate path method. In this methodology, critical columns and adjacent braces, if present, are instantaneously removed from an analysis model and the ability of the model to successfully absorb member loss is investigated. Member removal in this manner is intended to represent a situation where an extreme event or abnormal load destroys the member. The simulation results show that while both systems benefit from placement of the seismically designed frames on the perimeter of the building, the eccentrically braced frame is less vulnerable to progressive collapse than the special concentrically braced frame. Improvement in behavior is due to improved system and member layouts in the former compared to the latter rather than the use of more stringent seismic detailing.","steel frames, progressive collapse, macro-model, finite element, special concentrically braced frames, eccentrically braced frames, seismic detailing, computer simulation, seismic design"
"AbstractThis paper presents a holistic postoccupancy evaluation (POE) framework and its application to a campus residential facility. The development of a framework was based on an extensive review of literature and an identification of a comprehensive set of performance indicators. Multiple evaluation techniques were employed, including the review of existing documents, interviews, walkthroughs, questionnaire surveys, and spot measurements. The importance-satisfaction (IS) matrix was utilized to identify building performance successes and failures. The study shows that occupants are moderately satisfied with their residential environment. Specific issues identified were related to HVAC and lighting systems, among others. The holistic POE framework will help to derive more qualitative feedback in housing evaluation studies for more reliable decision making. This study bridges the research gap for the need for more holistic forms of POE in the facilities management sector.

"Diabetic nephropathy has become the single most important cause of endstage renal failure in most countries of the Western world. Against this background, the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and its blockade command considerable interest. In diabetic patients and in diabetic animals, the circulating components of the RAS are suppressed. Although the evidence is not completely uniform, there are indirect arguments (renal hemodynamic response to RAS blockade, AT1 receptor expression), however, which would be consistent with increased intrarenal action of angiotensin (ANG) II. There is solid evidence that ACE inhibitors effectively interfere with progression of micro-albuminuria both in IDDM and NIDDM. They also prevent progression of advanced renal failure in IDDM, while there is only preliminary evidence in this respect for NIDDM. ACE inhibitors are superior to conventional antihypertensive agents (with the possible exception of some calcium channel blockers), but such superiority is seen only when the levels of blood pressure are relatively high. In diabetic animals, treatment with ANG II receptor blockers interferes with the development of glomerular lesions. In acute and subacute studies on diabetic patients, ANG II receptor blockers reduced albuminuria (or proteinuria) more than beta-blockers. Head-on comparison of equipotent doses ACE inhibitors and ANG II receptor blockers in non-diabetic patients produced equal reductions in proteinuria. The long-term effects of ANG II receptor blockers on progression of advanced diabetic nephropathy is the object of two large international studies. The results will not be available before the year 2000.","ace inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, renin angiotensin system, dia- betic nephropathy, diabetes mellitus, renal function, blood pressure, hemodynamic response"
"The paper proposes an algorithm for digital relaying for the differential protection of large transformers. The digital filters, intended to extract the fundamental frequency component and the second and fifth harmonic components to provide operating and restraint signals respectively, are based on the discrete Hartley transform. To distinguish internal faults from magnetizing inrush and overexcitation conditions, a fault discriminant is defined here in terms of the average values of the aforementioned frequency components. The frequency responses of the proposed filters have been evaluated from a Z-transform and presented here. The efficacies of the filters and fault discriminant have been checked on a mainframe computer using simulation equations for internal fault and magnetizing inrush conditions. A threshold value has been determined for the fault discriminant after studying the effect on it of various transformer parameters and working conditions. With this value of the threshold, the relay operates within 17.5 ms of inception of any internal fault and restrains on magnetizing inrush.","discrete hartley transform, digital relay, digital filter, electric transformer, harmonic"
"This study was undertaken to help confirm the percentages concerning the presence or absence of the flexor digitorum brevis muscle tendon to the fifth toe. We also hope to be able to determine the presence based on gender and nationality. It is known to be absent occasionally; however, there is no definitive study dedicated to its prevalence. Using a pool of 60 cadavers, 97 total feet were included in our analysis. Of these feet, 47 (48%) lacked a flexor digitorum brevis tendon to the fifth toe at all. Furthermore, 25 (26%) had notably small tendons to the fifth toe. The final 25 (26%) had what the researchers deemed present tendons. This information could be helpful in surgical planning, including tendon transfer techniques, and biomechanical evaluations.

There are 4 synchronous requirements for redundant pole control system: parameter transfer, control algorithm, excitatory input and control output. This paper provides the implement methods: using pole control system design, HMI design, pole control application program design and platform design to realize the synchronization. The most kernel part should start from the hardware and sofeware design of the platform. It uses CPU + FPGA and 'fix delay' + 'phase-locked synchronization' design to guarantee the hard synchronization between trigger pulse and system synchronous voltage.

"Chronic obstipation and fecal impaction in children can be difficult management problems for pediatricians. We describe a novel approach to the management of obstipation and fecal impaction: the implantation of the button gastrostomy device in the appendiceal stump or the terminal ileum. We report the procedure in two children. One child had pseudoobstruction syndrome complicated by recurrent obstipation; the other had cystic fibrosis complicated by recurrent obstruction from meconium ileus equivalent. Both children received a polyethylene glycol/electrolyte solution, with or without pancreatic enzymes, which was administered through the button. The children have remained essentially asymptomatic for at least 10 months. We believe that this is the first report of the use of a button gastrostomy device to successfully manage chronic obstipation and recurrent fecal impaction in children.","meconium ileus equivalent, obstipation, fecal impaction, pseudoobstruction syndrome"
"Fever greater than 38 degrees C is a cardinal sign of patients with the severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS). To reduce the risk of nosocomial cross infections, screening all patients and visitors who visit hospitals and clinics for fever at the entrance of every hospital building has become a standard protocol in Taiwan during the SARS epidemic from mid-April to mid-June 2003. We used a digital infrared thermal imaging (DITI) system (Telesis Spectrum 9000 MB) to conduct mass screening of patients and visitors who entered the hospital to identify those with fever. The DITI system has two components: a sensor head and a PC imaging workstation. The sensor head is an optic-mechanical device which consists of imagining optics for focusing the infrared source information on the infrared detector. The infrared images are further converted into electrical signals, which are then processed for real-time display on the monitor. During the period from April 13 to May 12 2003, 72,327 outpatients and visitors entered Taipei Medical University-Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. A total of 305 febrile patients (0.42%) was detected by infrared thermography. Among them, three probable SARS patients were identified after thorough studies including contact history, laboratory tests and radiology examinations. The findings suggests that infrared thermography was an effective and reliable tool ideal for mass-screening patients with fever in the initial phase of screening for SARS patients at a busy hospital which sees approximately 3,000 outpatients every weekday during the SARS epidemic.","public health, spectrum, real time, infrared"

"This study considers a multi-storey composite frame subject to a fire which travels vertically between three floors. Previous work has analysed the behaviour of this structure when subject to simultaneous fires on three floors. It highlighted the importance of the cooling regime adopted and the relative axial stiffness of the steel beams to the overall behaviour of the structure. This paper extends that work by investigating the more realistic case of a vertically travelling fire. Various inter-floor time delays are considered as well as two floor beam sizes. It is found that the inter-floor time delay affects the global behaviour substantially. The behaviour is also in part dependent on the stiffness of the floor beams. Axial forces caused by thermal expansion in individual floors may induce cyclic loading on the column which is not normally considered in structural fire design but may be important in determining structural behaviour. Identifying a worst-case rate of vertical fire spread is not possible due to the range of structural responses, so it is recommended that designers consider several rates of spread and ensure structural integrity for each.","Travelling fires, Performance-based design, Multi-storey, Fire, Structural design, Modelling"

"The manufacturing process of cold-formed thin-walled steel members induces cold work which can be characterized by the co-existent residual stresses and equivalent plastic strains and has a significant effect on their structural behaviour and strength. The present paper and the companion paper are concerned with the prediction of residual stresses and co-existent equivalent plastic strains in stainless steel sections formed by the press-braking method. This manufacturing process consists of the following two distinct stages: (i) coiling and uncoiling of the sheets, and (ii) press-braking operations. This paper first presents an analytical solution for the residual stresses and the co-existent equivalent plastic strains that arise from the second stage while a corresponding analytical solution for the first stage is presented in the companion paper. In both solutions, plane strain pure bending is assumed and the effect of material anisotropy is taken into account. On the basis of these two analytical solutions, an analytical model is presented to predict residual stresses and equivalent plastic strains in press-braked stainless sections. The predictions of the analytical model are shown to be in close agreement with results from a finite element-based method, demonstrating the validity and accuracy of the analytical model. The analytical model provides a much simpler method for the accurate prediction of residual stresses and equivalent plastic strains in different parts of a press-braked stainless steel section than a finite element-based method.","stainless steel, finite element simulation, cold-formed sections, press-braking, residual stresses, material anisotropy, cold bending, finite element, analytic solution, residual stress"

"Since using a novel silver-impregnated antimicrobial dressing (Aquacel Ag, ConvaTec, Princeton, NJ) in our pediatric patients with partial-thickness burns, hospital LOS has been significantly reduced. Here we investigated whether there was concomitant cost-effectiveness of this approach.We retrospectively reviewed Burn Registry Data from a large Children's Hospital Burn Unit from January 2005 through August 2005 for inpatients with partial-thickness burns treated with Aquacel Ag. A comparison group was composed of patients from the same period the previous year treated with silver sulfadiazine cream (SSD, Par Pharmaceuticals, Woodcliff, NJ) and matched for age and %TBSA burned. Patients with inhalation injury or full-thickness burns were excluded. Intent-to-treat analysis was limited to patients with less than 22% TBSA burn. Direct costs and total charges were compared statistically after log transformation due to the skewedness of the data.Total charges and direct costs were significantly lower for Aquacel Ag-treated patients (n = 38) than for SSD-treated patients (n = 39) (P = .004 and P < .001, respectively). In addition, Aquacel Ag-treated patients had a shorter LOS than SSD-treated patients.These data strongly support our findings that the application of Aquacel Ag reduces hospital LOS which results in a significant cost savings in the care of pediatric patients with partial-thickness burns.","hospital costs, direct costs, partial-thickness burns, total charges, total body surface area, length of stay, dc, tc, los, silver-impregnated hydrofiber dressing, tbsa, cost effectiveness"
"Background/Purpose: Extended left hepatectomy, also referred to as left hepatic trisegmentectomy, in which segments II, III, IV, V, and VIII are excised, is rarely performed in children. Experience with 7 such resections is reported to describe the anatomy, technique, indications, and outcomes of the operation. Methods: The medical records of all pediatric patients treated at our institution over the last 15 years who underwent extended left hepatectomy were reviewed. Demographic information as well as operative, pathological, and follow-up data were analyzed. Results: Seven patients underwent extended left hepatectomy over this period. There were 5 boys and 2 girls ranging in age between 4 months and 9 years with a median age of 3.1 years. Follow-up ranged from 8 months to 5 years with a median of 3.5 years. Diagnoses included hepatoblastoma (HB, n = 3), focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH, n = 1), leiomyosarcoma (LMS, n = 1), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, n = 1), and metastatic neuroblastoma (NB, n = 1). All surgical margins were grossly negative. Median operative blood loss was 13 mL/kg (range, 5 to 32 mL/kg), and mean hospital stay was 9 days (range, 7 to 12 days). No major intra- or postoperative complications were encountered, and there was no perioperative mortality. The 3 HB patients, 1 FNH patient, 1 LMS patient, and 1 NB patient are without evidence of disease, whereas the 1 child with HCC died of recurrent and distant disease. The 6 surviving children have normal hepatic function. Conclusion: Although technically challenging and rarely performed, extended resection of the left hepatic lobe is feasible in children and can yield curative results with minimal morbidity.","extended left hepatectomy, liver, hepatoblastoma, surgery, medical records"
"Developers and purchasers of controlled health terminologies require valid mechanisms for comparing terminological systems. By Controlled Health Vocabularies, we refer to terminologies and terminological systems designed to represent clinical data at a granularity consistent with the practice of today's healthcare delivery. Comprehensive criterion for the evaluation of such systems historically have been lacking and the known criteria are inconsistently applied. Although there are many papers which describe specific desirable features of a controlled health vocabulary, to date there is not a consistent guide for evaluators of terminologies to reference, which will help them compare implementations of terminological systems on an equal footing [Methods Inf. Med. 37 (1998) 394, J. Am. Med. Inform. Assoc. 5 (1998) 503].

On the theoretical aspect, we analyze the existence of the equilibrium points for our neural network. In addition, we prove that if the equilibrium point exists for the neural network, then any such equilibrium point is both asymptotically and bounded (Lagrange) stable for any initial state. Furthermore, linear programming and certain quadratical programming problems (not necessarily convex) can be also solved by the neural network. Simulation results on several problems including a nonconvex one are also reported.","neural network, linear programming, initial state, simulation result, new neural network, stability, artificial neural network, linear complementarity problem, unconstrained minimization problem, equilibrium point, certain quadratical programming problem"
"Burnout is the result of unmanaged stress that has been shown to affect those working in the healthcare professions. Although much research has been conducted on burnout among nurses, physicians and other health professionals, there is limited documentation on the phenomenon among dietitians. The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence of burnout among dietitians in Ontario, Canada, determine the demographic variables associated with burnout, and compare these results with burnout data for other healthcare professionals.The Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey and a demographic questionnaire were emailed to registered dietitians.The dietitians surveyed experienced a moderate amount of emotional exhaustion (mean = 19.96), a low level of depersonalisation (mean = 4.31) and a moderate sense of personal accomplishment (mean = 38.61). Statistically significant relationships were found between years as a dietitian and personal accomplishment (r = 0.16; P = 0.05), age and personal accomplishment (r = 0.15; P = 0.01), hours worked per week and emotional exhaustion (r = 0.17; P = 0.01) and hours worked per week and depersonalisation (r = 0.14; P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in mean burnout scores across the five areas of practice. Over 57% of dietitians had scores indicative of moderate to high levels of burnout overall.Although dietitians have lower levels of burnout compared to other healthcare professionals, moderate levels of emotional exhaustion and only moderate levels of personal accomplishment remain workplace issues for this professional group.","questionnaires, nutrition, incidence, services, stress, emotional exhaustion, physicians, burnout, health, documentation"
"Job stress is an integral part of the organizational landscape and particularly severe in the sales profession. A host of studies have looked at felt stress, its antecedents, and consequences. This research examines how employee resistance to change and a manager's decisiveness affect the salesperson's felt stress and turnover intentions. This study shows that the salesperson's resistance to change is positively associated with felt stress. Study results also show that the impact of an employee's resistance to change on felt stress is moderated by a manager's decisiveness. Model hypotheses are tested with responses from 255 bank salespeople in India.","turnover intention, felt stress, manager's decisiveness, resistance to change"
"The Theory of Planned Behavior is used to predict a variety of behaviors, but its use in dealing with predicting e-commerce intentions in small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and in developing countries is limited. We use the TPB to model intentions to adopt e-commerce among 212 managers/owners of SMEs in Chile. Hierarchical regression results show that the subjective norm and attitude constructs positively and significantly predict intentions, but the perceived behavioral control construct does not. Results can be used by developing countries, especially those in Latin America, to encourage the adoption of e-commerce among SMEs.","smes, theory of planned behavior, information technology, e-commerce, electronic commerce, latin america, developing country, e commerce"
"The parameters in plastic injection moulding are highly nonlinear and interacting. Good control of plastic melt temperature for injection moulding is very important in reducing operator setup time, assuring consistent product quality, and preventing thermal degradation of the melt. Step response testing was performed on the barrel heating zones on an industrial injection moulding machine (IMM). The open loop responses indicated a high degree of process coupling between the heating zones. From these experimental step responses, a multiple-input-multiple-output model predictive control strategy was developed and practically implemented. The requirement of negligible overshoot is important to the plastics industry for preventing material overheating and wastage, and reducing machine operator setup time. A generic learning and self-optimizing MPC methodology was developed and implemented on the IMM to control melt temperature for any polymer to be moulded on any machine having different electrical heater capacities. The control performance was tested for varying setpoint trajectories typical of normal machine operations. The results showed that the predictive controller provided good control of melt temperature for all zones with negligible oscillations, and, therefore, eliminated material degradation and extended machine setup time.","material properties, predictive control, self-optimizing, injection moulding, model predictive control, oscillations"
"7 advanced graduate students in clinical psychology ranked, in an order most descriptive of optimal personality integration, 20 abbreviated paragraphs of Murray's ""desires and effects of the 20 manifest needs."" There was highly significant agreement between judges, and this pattern of needs is discussed as a conceptualization of mental health. 116 male research scientists, using the same paragraphs, described themselves. Deviation of self-descriptions from the ideal related significantly to measures of creativity, ego strength, manifest anxiety, autonomy, and authoritarian values. Strong conflict on specific Blacky scales was frequently associated with marked deviation of a need related to the particular psychosexual issue. Methodological considerations in defining mental health, the role of mental health in creativity, and the value of self-description in assessment are discussed. (22 ref.)

"A theoretical investigation of the effects of elastic coherency strain on the thermodynamics, kinetics, and morphology of intercalation in single LiFePO(4) nanoparticles yields new insights into this important battery material. Anisotropic elastic stiffness and misfit strains lead to the unexpected prediction that low-energy phase boundaries occur along {101} planes, while conflicting reports of phase boundary orientations are resolved by a partial loss of coherency in the [001] direction. Elastic relaxation near surfaces leads to the formation of a striped morphology with a characteristic length scale predicted by the model, yielding an estimate of the interfacial energy. The effects of coherency strain on solubility and galvanostatic discharge are studied with a reaction-limited phase-field model that quantitatively captures the influence of misfit strain, particle size, and temperature on solubility seen in experiments. Coherency strain strongly suppresses phase separation during discharge, which enhances rate capability and extends cycle life. The effects of elevated temperature and the feasibility of nucleation are considered in the context of multiparticle cathodes.","Li-ion battery, LiFePO4, phase-field model, coherency strain, phase boundaries, stripe morphology, Butler-Volmer kinetics"
"Exploring the role of psychological contracts, this study proposes that different organizational cultures are associated with relational psychological contracts compared to transactional contracts while both types of contracts serve as mediators. While clan cultures positively impact relational contracts and are negatively associated with transactional contracts, hierarchical cultures have the reverse effect. In addition, psychological contract types mediate the two culture types' relationship to both organizational commitment and employee yearly earnings. In sum, clan cultures relate to more positive organizational outcomes than hierarchical cultures, a finding which as implications for future research and practice.","transactional contracts, hierarchy culture, clan culture, affective commitment, relational contracts, yearly earnings, psychological contracts, organizational culture, organizational commitment, psychological contract"
The present study provides evidence on the mobility effects of researchers from the public R&D system with regard to firm's innovation process. This issue is particularly novel and important as these researchers contribute to the production and transfer of knowledge previously developed and accumulated in the public R&D system. The findings confirm that scientific knowledge which public researchers provide has a positive influence on both inputs and outputs of the firms' innovation process. The fact that firms have access to additional knowledge which is complementary to that they already hold represents a spur for exploiting and applying this new knowledge. The firms in this study continually increased their in-house R&D investments. As a result of these investments firms create new knowledge of a unique and valuable type. The study draws two important conclusions geared to providing a greater efficiency in human resource management and to improve the design of technology policies.,"public researchers' mobility, r&d., innovation management, knowledge management, scientific knowledge transfer, r&d"
"Privacy includes the right of individuals and organisations to determine for themselves when, how and to what extent information about them is communicated to others. The growing need of managing large amounts of both clinical and genetic data raises important legal and ethical challenges. This paper introduces some of the privacy-protection problems related to classical and genomic medicine, and highlights the relevance of trusted third parties and of privacy-enhancing techniques (PETs) in the context of data collection, e.g., for research. Practical approaches based on two pseudonymisation models, for both batch data collection and interactive data storage, are presented. The actual application of the described techniques today proves the possible benefits for medicine that innovative privacy-enhancing techniques can provide. Technical PET solutions can unlock valuable data sources, otherwise not available.","trusted third parties, pseudonymisation, confidentiality, genomic medicine, privacy-enhancing techniques"
"Regulation of osteoclast differentiation is an aspect central to the understanding of the pathogenesis and the treatment of bone diseases such as autoimmune arthritis and osteoporosis. In fact, excessive signaling by RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family essential for osteoclastogenesis, may contribute to such pathological conditions. Here we summarize our current work on the negative regulation of osteoclastogenesis by unique signaling crosstalk between RANKL and interferons (IFNs). First, activated T cells maintain bone homeostasis by counterbalancing the action of RANKL through production of IFN-gamma. This cytokine induces rapid degradation of the RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB) adapter protein TRAF6 (TNF-receptor-associated factor 6), resulting in strong inhibition of the RANKL-induced activation of NF-kappaB and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase). Second, RANKL induces the IFN-beta gene but not IFN-alpha genes, in osteoclast precursor cells, and that IFN-beta strongly inhibits the osteoclast differentiation by interfering with the RANKL-induced expression of c-Fos. The series of in vivo experiments revealed that these two distinct IFN-mediated regulatory mechanisms are both important to maintain homeostasis of bone resorption. Collectively, these studies revealed novel aspects of the two types of IFN, beyond their original roles in the immune response, and may offer a molecular basis for the treatment of bone diseases.","interferon, osteoporosis, arthritis, osteoclast, rankl, carrier proteins, immune response, signal transduction, tumor necrosis factor, bone resorption, cell differentiation"
"This study examines whether the new ventures success of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the biotech industry relates with the characteristics of strategic alliances. The study advances a research conceptual framework. Using sampling data gathered from 189 Taiwan biotech firms through a benchmarking questionnaire, the study tests six hypotheses employing structural equations. The findings are generally consistent with the literature. The study supports all hypotheses. Consequently, the results show that strategic alliances improve SMEs' new venture success. This research provides managerial implications for both entrepreneurs and managers and some suggestions for future research.","strategic alliance, smes, biotech new venture, small and medium enterprise, industrial relations, data gathering, conceptual framework"
"The existing interpretation methods for piezocone penetration tests (CPTU) are reviewed for prediction of the constrained compression modulus (Es). Three expressway sites in Jiangsu Province are selected for this study. In each site, CPTU tests are performed supplemented by consolidation tests using high-quality undisturbed soft soil samples. Then, Es-predicted methods based on the CPTU tests are compared and evaluated. The new correlations are also developed to predict the values of Es from the cone tip resistance (qc), corrected cone tip resistance (qt) and net cone tip resistance (qn) for soft clay in Jiangsu Province. Furthermore, the correlations are verified by comparing the total settlements predicted from CPTU and the measured settlements for one selected expressway site. The results show that the Senneset et al (1989) method based on the net cone resistance is able to predict Es better than the other methods. The predicted total settlements based on CPTU parameters show a better agreement with the measured ones. Accordingly, the reliability of the application of CPTU for Es and settlement prediction is verified.","Compression modulus, Piezocone penetration test, Settlement prediction, Soft clay"
"With this study, we advance the understanding about the processes through which stories are retold. A collection of story retellings can be considered as a network of stories, in which links between stories represent pre-textual (or ancestral) relationships. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the structure and evolution of such story networks: we construct a story network for a large diachronic collection of Dutch literary retellings of Red Riding Hood, and compare this network to one derived from a corpus of paper chain letters. In the analysis, we first provide empirical evidence that the formation of these story networks is subject to age-dependent selection processes with a strong lopsidedness towards shorter time-spans between stories and their pre-texts (i.e. 'young' story versions are preferred in producing new versions). Subsequently, we systematically compare these findings with and among predictions of various formal models of network growth to determine more precisely which kinds of attractiveness are also at play or might even be preferred as explicatory models. By carefully studying the structure and evolution of the two story networks, then, we show that existing stories are differentially preferred to function as a new version's pre-text given three types of attractiveness: (i) frequency-based and (ii) model-based attractiveness which (iii) decays in time.","chain letters, children's literature, cultural evolution, folktales, network theory"
"We explore in this study how infants may derive phonetic categories from adult input that are highly variable. Neural networks in the form of self-organizing maps (SOMs; ) were used to simulate unsupervised learning of Mandarin tones. In Simulation 1, we trained the SOMs with syllable-sized continuous F(0) contours, produced by multiple speakers in connected speech, and with the corresponding velocity profiles (D1). No attempt was made to reduce the large amount of variability in the input or to add to the input any abstract features such as height and slope of the F(0) contours. In the testing phase, reasonably high categorization rate was achieved with F(0) profiles, but D1 profiles yielded almost perfect categorization of the four tones. Close inspection of the learned prototypical D1 profile clusters revealed that they had effectively eliminated surface variability and directly reflected articulatory movements toward the underlying targets of the four tones as proposed by . Additional simulations indicated that a further learning step was possible through which D1 prototypes with one-to-one correspondence to the tones were derived from the prototype clusters learned in Simulation 1. Implications of these findings for theories of language acquisition, speech perception and speech production are discussed.","category formation, contextual tonal variation, target approximation, theories of speech production and perception, lexical tone, infant speech perception, language acquisition, unsupervised learning, self-organizing maps, speech, acoustics, speech production, classification, self organizing maps, phonetics, simulation, speech perception, mandarin chinese"
"Lower-extremity wounds are a major complication of diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reflects glycemia over 2-3 months and is the standard measure used to monitor glycemia in diabetic patients, but results from studies have not shown a consistent association of HbA1c with wound healing. We hypothesized that elevated HbA1c would be most associated with poor wound healing. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of 183 diabetic individuals treated at the Johns Hopkins Wound Center. Our primary outcome was wound-area healing rate (cm(2) per day). Calibrated tracings of digital images were used to measure wound area. We estimated coefficients for healing rate using a multiple linear regression model controlling for clustering of wounds within individuals and other common clinic variables. The study population was 45% female and 41% African American, with a mean age of 61 years. Mean HbA1c was 8.0%, and there were 2.3 wounds per individual (310 wounds total). Of all measures assessed, only HbA1c was significantly associated with wound-area healing rate. In particular, for each 1.0% point increase in HbA1c, the daily wound-area healing rate decreased by 0.028 cm(2) per day (95% confidence interval: 0.003, 0.0054, P = 0.027). Our results suggest that glycemia, as assessed by HbA1c, may be an important biomarker in predicting wound-healing rate in diabetic patients.JID JOURNAL CLUB ARTICLE: For questions, answers, and open discussion about this article, please go to http://www.nature.com/jid/journalclub.","cutaneous biology, skin disease, psoriasis, dermatitis, keratinocyte, melanocyte, skin cancer, dendritic cells, epidermis"
"The occurrence of heavy cyanobacterial blooms has become a worldwide problem, as a consequence of eutrophication of the aquatic ecosystems; furthermore, 60% to 75% of these blooms have been found to be toxic. Microcystins (MCYSTs), the predominant toxins of cyanobacterial blooms, are associated with mortality and illness in both animals and humans. Laboratory-controlled experiments studying the effects of different microcystins on the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) have revealed various histopathological alterations. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of chronic or subchronic exposure of fish to microcystins under natural environmental conditions by examining the possible histopathological changes associated with a dense cyanobacterial bloom and determining the microcystin contents of fish tissues. Common carps (C. carpio) were caught from Lake Karla (Greece), during a dense cyanobacterial bloom. The concentration of MCYSTs in the fish liver, kidney and muscle tissues was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The pseudogaster contents were analysed, and a histopathological examination was performed using light and electron microscopy. Severe alterations were detected in the liver and the kidney, suggesting that the toxic effects were caused by various pollutants that were particularly associated with microcystins. The histopathological findings are also discussed, taking into consideration the health conditions of the common carp as a commercial fish species. The mechanisms of expansion of the microcystins and the poisoning of aquatic organisms (e.g. fish) are not yet known in the Lake Karla ecosystem. Future research may focus on identifying the changes caused by microcystins and other factors that exert similar effects on fish tissues, as well as on establishing the overall combined effect of all these factors on fish health.","Cyanobacterial bloom, Liver, Kidney, Muscle, Tissues, Cyprinus carpio, Lake Karla (Greece)"

"Software Process Improvement (SPI) typically involves rather complex organizational changes. Acknowledging that managers can approach these changes in quite different ways, this paper addresses the following question: what perspectives do the research literature offer on SPI as organizational change and how is this knowledge presented and published? To answer this question, we analyzed SPI research publications with a main emphasis on organizational change using Gareth Morgan's organizational metaphors (1996) as analytical lenses. In addition, we characterized each article along the following dimensions: knowledge orientation (normative versus descriptive), theoretical emphasis (high versus low), main audience (practitioner versus academic), geographical origin (Scandinavia, the Americas, Europe, or the Asia-Pacific), and publication level (high versus low ranked journal). The review demonstrates that the literature as a whole is firmly grounded in both theory and practice, it appropriately targets both practitioner and academic audiences, and Scandinavian and American researchers are the main contributors. However, the distribution of articles across Morgan's metaphors is uneven and reveals knowledge gaps that present new avenues for research. The current literature offers important insights into organizational change in SPI when viewed through machine, organism, flux and transformation, and brain metaphors. Practitioners may use these articles to guide SPI initiatives. In contrast, the impact of culture, dominance, psychic prison, and politics in SPI has only received scant attention. We argue that these perspectives could offer important additional insights into the challenges involved in managing SPI. Researchers are therefore advised to engage in new SPI research based on one or more of these perspectives. Overall, the paper offers research directions and management lessons, and it provides a roadmap to help identify insights and specific articles related to SPI as organizational change.","organizational metaphor, research literature offer, organizational change, metaphorical analysis, spi initiative, complex organizational change, knowledge gap, literature review, software process improvement, research direction, spi research publication, new spi research, current literature, metaphors, images of organization"

CGA is a holistic assessment model designed to determine frail older people's medical and mental health status, as well as functional, social and environmental issues. When applied by nurses, it can enable individualised planning for health, safety and wellbeing. This article presents the case of an older man who had a three-month history of falls. After his most recent fall he was admitted to an emergency department, where examination identified no significant abnormal pathology, and subsequently to a nurse-led older person's clinic. The article describes how a CGA approach was adopted to assess the man, establish an underlying diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, and develop a personalised care plan to address immediate falls risk and long-term planning.","advance care plans, comprehensive geriatric assessment, falls, frailty, older people"
"This study proposes an analytical method for determining the shear strengths of steel reinforced concrete deep beams under the failure mode of concrete crushing originally based on the softened strut-and-tie model. The proposed method is a good physical model that can correlate well with the observed failure phenomenon of steel reinforced concrete deep beams. By comparing the predictions of the proposed method with the available test results from the literature, it was found that the proposed method is capable of predicting the shear strengths for steel reinforced concrete deep beams with sufficient accuracy. The shear-carrying behavior of steel reinforced concrete deep beams is highly influenced by the ratios of flange width to gross width, the shear span-to-depth ratios, and the concrete strengths. When the ratio of flange width to gross width is low, the shear-carrying capacities of steel reinforced concrete deep beams increase with the increasing ratio. However, if the ratio of the flange width to gross width is higher than a critical value, then the failure mode of steel reinforced concrete deep beams will be converted from diagonal compression failure into bearing failure.","shear strength, diagonal compression failure, bearing failure, steel reinforced concrete, deep beam, carrying capacity, failure mode, critical value, physical model"

"Safety is a system property, hence the high-level safety requirements are incorporated into the implementation of system components. In this paper, we propose an optimized traceability analysis method which is based on the means-ends and whole-part concept of the approach for cognitive systems engineering to trace these safety requirements. A system consists of hardware, software, and humans according to a whole-part decomposition. The safety requirements of a system and its components are enforced or implemented through a means-ends lifecycle. To provide evidence of the safety of a system, the means-ends and whole-part traceability analysis method will optimize the creation of safety evidence from the safety requirements, safety analysis results, and other system artifacts produced through a lifecycle. These sources of safety evidence have a causal (cause-consequence) relationship between each other. The failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA), the hazard and operability analysis (HAZOP), and the fault tree analysis (FTA) techniques are generally used for safety analysis of systems and their components. These techniques cover the causal relations in a safety analysis. The causal relationships in the proposed method make it possible to trace the safety requirements through the safety analysis results and system artifacts. We present the proposed approach with an example, and described the usage of TRACE and NuSRS tools to apply the approach.","safety requirement, whole-part traceability analysis, safety evidence, safety, cognitive safety engineering, safety analysis, safety analysis result, operability analysis, system artifact, high-level safety requirement, fault tree analysis, traceability, means-ends and whole-part, optimized traceability analysis method, effect analysis, failure mode and effect analysis"

"Described is the development and application of a versatile semisynthetic strategy, based on a combination of sortase-mediated coupling and tetrazine ligation chemistry, which can be exploited for the efficient incorporation of tunable functionality into chimeric recombinant proteins. To demonstrate the scope of the method, the assembly of a set of bivalent ligands, which integrate members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) ligand family, is described. By using a series of bivalent EGFs with variable intraligand spacing, the differences in structure were correlated with the ability to bias signaling in the ErbB receptor family in a cell motility assay. Biasing away from EGFR-HER2 dimerization with a bivalent EGF was observed to reduce cell motility in an intraligand distance-dependent fashion, thus demonstrating the utility of the approach for acutely perturbing receptor-mediated cell signaling pathways.","biological activity, ligand design, protein modifications, receptors, structure-activity relationships"
"This study aimed to illustrate the first report of extrarenal Wilms tumor occurring in a family.Retrospective case note review of 3 siblings, 2 of which presented with extrarenal Wilms tumor. Immunohistochemical analysis for WT1 gene product was performed together with molecular genetic linkage studies.A 3-year-old boy had excision of a right-sided extrarenal retroperitoneal Wilms tumor and nephrectomy followed by chemotherapy. At follow-up of 4 years, the boy was well and thriving. Aged 2 years, his sister developed a left-sided retroperitoneal extrarenal Wilms tumor. She had a tumor excision and nephrectomy followed by chemotherapy. She was well on follow-up more than a year after completion of treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis identified WT1 gene product within the tumor for both cases. Molecular genetic linkage studies showed no linkage between the index cases at FWT1 locus. Although possible linkage was demonstrated at WT1 locus, no mutation was found in the coding sequence and intron/exon boundaries of WT1 gene in index patient 1. A possible linkage between the index cases was also found at FWT2 locus. This could be a chance event because of the close relationship of the 2 patients.We could identify extrarenal Wilms tumor in a family for the first time. Immunohistochemical analysis showed WT1 gene products in both cases. Linkage studies for Wilms tumor genes within the family were inconclusive.

"The study examines the impact of on-line interface type on consumer search processes and choice. The article describes two major types: 2D interfaces which possess primarily interactivity capability versus the enhanced 3D interfaces that have superior vividness capability. The research addresses the question whether a particular family of interfaces is expected to force out the other or, alternatively, whether consumers would vary the usage of the type of interfaces under different shopping circumstances. The findings indicate that consumer search processes are indeed affected by the on-line interface type with different advantages to each, depending on the search situation. They provide support for its central hypotheses regarding process variables, such as shopping duration, number of examined brands, and the sequence of search. The effect due to interface is further reflected in the interaction between consumers' internal and external search and extends to consumer preferences and choice processes.","consumer search processes, virtual reality, on-line consumer behavior, 3d, on-line interface, internet, consumer behavior"
"The progress of non-invasive blood glucose determination based on mid-infrared spectroscopy is introduced firstly.

Using the spectra of simulated ISF, partial least square regression (PLSR) calibration model of glucose determination is estabished, and the value of root mean squares error of cross validation (RMSECV) is 9.6 mg/dL. While including the interference of stratum corneum from three volenteers individually, three RMSECV are obtained, and they are 17.4, 16.3 and 17.1 mg/dL, respectively. The results show that the effects of SC from different volenteers are the same nearly; including the interference of SC, the accuracy of the non-invasive blood glucose determination based on attenuated total reflection mid-infrared spectroscopy can reach 18 mg/dL.","Attenuated total reflection, Diabetics, Mid-infrared spectroscopy, Non-invasive blood glucose determination"
"Many studies claim to measure decision-making under risk by employing the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) scale, a self-report measure, or the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), a behavioural task. However, these tasks do not measure decision-making under risk but decision-making under uncertainty, a related but distinct concept. The present commentary discusses both the theoretical and empirical basis of the distinction between uncertainty and risk from the viewpoint of several scientific disciplines and reports how many studies wrongfully employ the DOSPERT scale and BART as risk-taking measures. Importantly, we call for proper distinguishing between (tasks measuring) decision-making under uncertainty and decision-making under risk in psychology, and related fields. We believe this is vital as research has shown that people's attitudes, behaviour, and brain activity differ between both concepts, indicating that confusing the concepts may lead researchers to erroneous conclusions.","BART, DOSPERT scale, decision-making, risk, uncertainty"
"Inpatient suicide attempters ( n = 37) were compared with never-suicidal psychiatric controls ( n = 29) with respect to prevalence and severity of personality disorder, history of aggression and assaultive behavior, and other measures of impulsive violence. Attempters, compared with controls, were more likely to show evidence of personality disorder or trait, particularly those of the borderline type. Attempters showed greater number of borderline symptoms than did controls, even after removing the item relating to suicidality. There were no differences between the groups with respect to lifetime history of aggression, history of assaultive behavior, or self-report measures of a tendency to impulsive aggression. Those attempters with personality disorder were much more likely to have made a previous attempt. The apparently high prevalence of personality disorder among adolescent inpatient suicide attempters indicates that the social impairment associated with personality disorder be viewed as an important aspect of treatment.","personality disorder, adolescent, suicide attempt, suicide prevention, occupational safety, injury prevention, human factors, ergonomics"
"The development of target-fishing approaches, aimed at identifying the possible protein targets of a small molecule, represents a hot topic in medicinal chemistry. A successful target-fishing approach would allow for the elucidation of the mechanism of action of all therapeutically interesting compounds for which the actual target is still unknown. Moreover, target-fishing would be essential for preventing adverse effects of drug candidates, by predicting their potential off-targets, and it would speed up drug repurposing campaigns. However, due to the huge number of possible protein targets that a small-molecule might interact with, experimental target-fishing approaches are out of reach. In silico target-fishing represents a valuable alternative, and examples of receptor-based approaches, exploiting the large number of crystallographic protein structures determined to date, have been reported in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, no proper evaluation of such approaches is, however, reported yet. In the present work, we extensively assessed the reliability of docking-based target-fishing strategies. For this purpose, a set of X-ray structures belonging to different targets was selected, and a dataset of compounds, including 10 experimentally active ligands for each target, was created. A target-fishing benchmark database was then obtained, and used to assess the performance of 13 different docking procedures, in identifying the correct target of the dataset ligands. Moreover, a consensus docking-based target-fishing strategy was developed and evaluated. The analysis highlighted that specific features of the target proteins could affect the reliability of the protocol, which however, proved to represent a valuable tool in the proper applicability domain. Our study represents the first extensive performance assessment of docking-based target-fishing approaches, paving the way for the development of novel efficient receptor-based target fishing strategies.","consensus docking, docking, reverse screening, target fishing"
"Sir, We read with interest the article by Rahman et al.1 It is pleasing that other researchers have been interested to further investigate the concept that optic disc appearance in glaucomatous disease may provide certain clues as to the aetiology and potential responsiveness to therapy. We believe that a major difference between the work of the Oxford group1 and our group2,3,4,5,6 relates to case selection. In the case of the Oxford study, 221 eyes of 250 patients (88%) with glaucoma were included in one of six groups, and only 29 eyes were excluded because they could not be securely classified. In contrast, in our studies less than 10% of examined optic discs could be classified using extremely strict inclusion criteria. In addition, all of our 'generalised enlargements' of the cup had to have photographic or case note evidence that the disc had in fact changed or was glaucomatous. As with the Oxford patients, the majority of our patients also had relatively early glaucoma (average mean deviation values of <10 dB). We think it unlikely that the population of patients presenting to the two departments differed to the degree implied by the large difference in percentage of optic discs considered to be classifiable (90 vs 10%). Case selection, therefore, might explain the negative findings presented by Rahman et al.1 In our work, extremely strict classifying criteria were utilised so as to provide groups of patients with 'pure' optic disc appearances and, while some of our discs were too damaged for classification, in the majority they were not classified because they had a mixed appearance with overlapping of categories. Although these stringent criteria provided interesting findings relating to potential aetiological mechanisms, it was at the expense of being less clinically relevant to the practising ophthalmologist. The Oxford group should be commended for attempting to classify more patients, which had the potential to provide more clinically relevant information. Unfortunately, this may have reduced the power of the study to identify possible differences relating to pathogenesis. It is hoped that the findings published by Rahman and coworkers does not diminish their interest, or that of others, in pursuing the concept that optic disc appearance may provide clues to improve our knowledge about the group of disorders collectively known as primary open angle glaucoma.","eye, ophthalmology, visual science, external eye disease, oculo-plastic surgery, orbital and lacrimal disease, ocular surface and corneal disorders, paediatric ophthalmology and strabismus, glaucoma, medical and surgical retina, neuro-ophthalmology, cataract and refractive surgery, ocular oncology, ophthalmic pathology"
"The use of cryptographic techniques such as encryption and hashing largely increases the energy consumption of sensors, which aggravates the original critical energy constraint problem of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). To reduce the burden of sensors, compression can be utilized. Since the traditional chaos-based schemes are not directly applicable for WSNs, we present a hybrid security solution. The hybrid security consists of 8-bit integer chaotic block encryption and a chaos-based message authentication codes. It aims to promote the security and performance of data gathering. In this paper, a hybrid security and compressive sensing-based scheme for multimedia sensor data gathering is presented. It has light security mechanism and thus decreases the complexity and energy consumption of system. Performance analysis about security and compression is carried out. The results show that our scheme is more applicable for WSNs multimedia data gathering from security and compression efficiency.","chaotic block encryption, wsns, compressive sensing, multimedia data gathering, encryption, network security, wireless sensor networks, wireless sensor network, block codes, energy efficiency, cryptography, authentication, data security, compressed sensing"

"Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily a sporadic condition which results mainly from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Its etiology remains enigmatic while its pathogenesis begins to be understood as a multifactorial cascade of deleterious factors. As of yet, most insights into PD pathogenesis are derived from toxic models of PD and show that the earlier cellular perturbations arising in dopaminergic neurons include oxidative stress and energy crisis. These alterations, rather than killing neurons, trigger subsequent death-related molecular pathways including elements of apoptosis. The fate of dopaminergic neurons in PD may also be influenced by additional factors such as excitotoxicity, emanating from the increased glutamatergic input from the subthalamic nucleus to the substantia nigra, and the glial response that arises in the striatum and the substantia nigra. In rare instances, PD can be familial, and those genetic forms have also provided clues to the pathogenesis of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuron death including abnormalities in the mechanisms of protein folding and degradation as well as mitochondrial function. Although more remains to be elucidated about the pathogenic cascade in PD, the compilation of all of the aforementioned alterations starts to shed light on why and how nigral dopaminergic neurons may degenerate in this prominent disease, that is PD.","cell death, mptp, genetics, protein folding"
"Lateral torsional buckling is the main limit state that must be checked for steel beams. Design codes provide different models for the analysis of this complex phenomenon. The present paper describes a comparative study of the interpretation of beam buckling of symmetrical sections in EN 1993-1-1 (EC3), its preliminary ENV-version and a Russian steel structure design code. In order to choose the nationally determined parameters in EC3, the impact of parameters on the safety level and overall design results has to be carefully studied. Modification factors, introduced in EC3, have moved the resistance for certain load distribution from ENV-based values closer to the Russian code.","bending, beam, lateral-torsional, buckling, eurocode 3, load distribution"
"The arrangement of single gold and palladium atoms deposited on the surface of a 3 monolayer thin film of MgO was investigated using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. While Pd atoms are arranged in a random fashion, Au forms an ordered array on the surface. The long-range ordering as well as the scanning tunneling microscopy appearance of single Au atoms on a 3 monolayer thin MgO film can be explained by partial charge transfer from the substrate to Au atoms as predicted recently by density functional theory calculations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 226104 (2005)10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.226104]. In contrast with that, Au atoms on a thick film were found to be essentially neutral.","charge transfer, density function theory, scanning tunneling microscopy, thin film"
"We describe 27 cases of multiple drug-resistant pneumococcal infection in Queensland children (7 cases) and adults (20 cases), between February 1995 and October 1996. Seven patients had invasive disease. Serotypes were those commonly associated with paediatric infections and included types 19F (15 strains), 14 (6), 23F (4), 6A (1) and 19A (1). No rifampicin or vancomycin resistance was encountered. However, pneumococci fully resistant to cotrimoxazole, erythromycin and tetracycline were isolated from 25 of 27 cases (93%). Strains with high level resistance to penicillin and chloramphenicol were also recovered from 16 (59%) and 19 (70%) patients respectively. Twelve of 16 penicillin-resistant isolates showed intermediate resistance to ceftriaxone and two strains were fully resistant to this antibiotic. Clones of types 19F and 14 pneumococci, each with two distinctive resistance patterns, appear to be established in south-east Queensland.","kevin love, in queensland mike gratten, gillian wood and janine fenton meningitis in new south wales, jane carlisle, chris ashurst-smith, erangini seneviratne, susan tiley, jacqueline schooneveldt, graeme nimmo, rob norton, robyn kelly"
"Chelex ion exchange beads loaded with a known amount (18.3% weight percentage (w/w)) of platinum, have been co-embedded with a mouse peritoneal cell population. To establish the influence of the various deconvolution methods applied, upon the platinum concentration in cytoplasmic granules and erythrocytes these cross-sectioned beads are used as a standard. It is concluded that irrespective of the deconvolution method chosen 1) the Pt concentration inside the particles is identical when the particles and the co-embedded Chelex Pt standard, are analysed strictly under the same instrumental conditions 2) the Pt concentration outside the particle is zero, or virtually zero when that element is absent there (erythrocyte surrounded by Epon) 3) the Pt concentration outside the particle in the surrounding cytoplasm was identical (when the element Pt was present there). The information about the elemental concentration obtained by point analysis in the STEM-mode in homogeneous objects was compared with the mean value obtained by the reduced raster method. The ratio between these values were constant. As an example of a heteromorphic, heterogeneous cell organelle population, the application of the method of integrated morphometrical and chemical (X-ray) analysis is demonstrated on lysosomes within a single human liver parenchymal cell, containing iron and cerium. It was shown that the cerium concentration (from the cytochemical reaction to detect acid phosphatase activity in lysosomes) was rather homogeneously distributed over the small population and in the individual lysosomes. The iron distribution was very inhomogeneous, both in its distribution over the lysosomal area, and among the lysosomes in the population.","cross section, cell morphology, iron, peroxidase, enzyme, acid phosphatase, instrumental conditioning, ion exchange, chemical analysis"
"Sex determination mechanisms differ among animal species, but it is not clear how these differences evolve. New sex determiners may arise in response to sexual conflicts, which occur when traits benefit one sex but hinder the other. We identified the genetic basis for the orange-blotch (OB) color pattern, a trait under sexually antagonistic selection in the cichlid fish of Lake Malawi, East Africa. The OB phenotype is due to a cis-regulatory mutation in the Pax7 gene. OB provides benefits of camouflage to females but disrupts the species-specific male color patterns used for mate recognition. We suggest that the resulting sexual conflict over the OB allele has been resolved by selection for a novel female sex determination locus that has invaded populations with an ancestral male sex determination system.","pigmentation, phenotype, linkage disequilibrium, melanophores, haplotypes, genetics, sex determination, gene expression regulation"
"Human behavioral genetic research aimed at characterizing the existence and nature of genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in cognitive ability, personality and interests, and psychopathology is reviewed. Twin and adoption studies indicate that most behavioral characteristics are heritable. Nonetheless, efforts to identify the genes influencing behavior have produced a limited number of confirmed linkages or associations. Behavioral genetic research also documents the importance of environmental factors, but contrary to the expectations of many behavioral scientists, the relevant environmental factors appear to be those that are not shared by reared together relatives. The observation of genotype-environment correlational processes and the hypothesized existence of genotype-environment interaction effects serve to distinguish behavioral traits from the medical and physiological phenotypes studied by human geneticists. Behavioral genetic research supports the heritability, not the genetic determination, of behavior.","genotype environment interaction, behavior genetics, gene environment interaction, genetics, human behavior"
"Meiosis in oocytes consists of two consecutive asymmetric cell divisions, each completed by the extrusion of one set of chromosomes into a small polar body. First polar body (PBI) extrusion is triggered by the inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), following the degradation of its regulatory subunit cyclin B1 by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. The present review covers the sequence of events leading to PBI extrusion, and compares them to the corresponding events in mitotic cell division.

"<p>New finite-element models for curved beam vibration analysis are derived from classical complementary variational principles of elastodynamics. The use of a spline approximation of the axis line (as previously introduced by the writers in the static case) allows for the a priori satisfaction of the dynamic differential equilibrium equations in a simple and effective way. More precisely, starting from the Hellinger-Reissner principle and making use of a linear interpolation of displacements and momentum fields, a very simple hybrid-mixed model is obtained that can be easily linked with general-purpose finite element packages. Alternatively, fully equilibrated models are derived from the complementary energy principle assuming as unknowns either the momentum or the stress resultant fields; in both cases highly accurate finite element models are obtained for which upper and lower bounds on eigenvalue estimates are readily available. Several examples are worked out that are capable of showing the efficiency and the wide spectrum of applicability of the proposed method. The comparison with two general-purpose finite element packages of large diffusion let us assess the high level of performance of the complementary energy models for curved elements.</p>","equilibrium, vibration, vibration analysis, finite element method"

The author states that Bingham's editorial reopens a superannuated though important problem in a not altogether constructive fashion. First of all, a distinction must be made between intelligence and I.Q. While the former may be constant, the latter is far less frequently constant than ""in the bare majority of instances."" If the I.Q. is subject to wide variations, then taunting the Bellevue psychometrist with bad names is obviously out of place.

"Protecting the intellectual property rights (IPR) of digital media is important because the illegal reproduction and modification of digital media has become increasingly serious. A robust DWT-based copyright verification scheme with Fuzzy ART that does not require the original image for ownership verification is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme, which combines DWT, Fuzzy ART, and the quantization process, converts an image into a short robust table with the embedded ownership information. Unlike general classification, such as k-mean and fuzzy c-means, the number of clusters can be adaptively decided by the vigilance parameter of Fuzzy ART. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is robust against common image processing, geometric distortions, and intentional attacks. The original image is not required to extract the embedded ownership image.","copyright protection, digital watermarking, discrete wavelet transform, fuzzy art, digital media, digital watermark, intellectual property right, image processing, k means"
"To examine the relationship between psychopathology and health care utilization beginning in the preschool (ages 2 to 5) years.Five hundred ten preschool children were enrolled through 68 primary care physicians. The test battery used for diagnoses included the Child Behavior Checklist, a developmental evaluation, the Rochester Adaptive Behavior Inventory, and a videotaped play session. Consensus DSM-III-R diagnoses were assigned using best-estimate procedures. Frequency of primary care visits was established through 1-year retrospective record review; mothers estimated total visits and emergency department (ED) use.Logistic regression models showed that a DSM-III-R diagnosis was related to increased ED use but not primary care or total visits. Greater functional impairment was associated with fewer primary care visits and more ED visits. Total, internalizing, and externalizing behavior problem scores were associated with increased primary care and total visits; ED visits were associated with increased total and internalizing problems. Child's health status consistently correlated with utilization.There is a consistent relationship between health care use and child psychopathology beginning in the preschool years.","primary care, health care utilization, child psychopathology, health care"

It is confirmed that the amorphous deposits showed better corrosion resistance than the crystalline deposits. The effects of composition and heat treatment temperature on microhardness have been studied. The deposits with middle boron content possess higher hardness. The structural change with annealing at different temperatures results in changes of hardness of the deposits. Their wettability is very weak.

"This paper introduces a theoretical framework that recognises the rehabilitation needs of people who have cancer and offers a multi-tiered model to meet these needs. Various models for providing survivorship care have been previously proposed, giving rise to multiple possible delivery systems. Existing cancer rehabilitation frameworks recognise different phases of illness, goals of care and the need for services at all stages of illness. The 'Stained Glass Cancer Rehabilitation Framework' incorporates survivor needs and rehabilitation modalities, arranged in a practical hierarchy and builds on earlier models. A broad view of rehabilitation services considers complexity, temporal and geographic factors. Recognition that needs emerge over time demands a routine long-term approach to screening for physical, functional and psychosocial rehabilitation needs by medical and other health professionals. New methods of care delivery and coordination from specialist to primary care settings are needed, long after treatment is completed. Service delivery infrastructure supported by funding reform and training of rehabilitation professionals in delivering appropriate interventions for cancer survivors is essential, together with more research into cancer rehabilitation interventions, functional outcomes and their delivery.","cancer, framework, model, needs, rehabilitation, survivor"
"The level to which CASE technology has been successfully deployed in IS and software development organisations has been at best variable. Much has been written about an apparent mismatch between user expectations of the technology and the products which are developed for the growing marketplace. In this paper we explore how this tension has developed over time, with the aim of identifying and characterising the major factors contributing to it. We identify three primary themes: volatility and plurality in the marketplace; the close relationship between tools and development methods; and the context sensitivity of feature assessment. By exploring the tension and developing these themes we hope to further the debate on how to improve evaluation of CASE prior to adoption.","case technology, software development, evolution of case technology, case adoption, literature review, technology"
A power system stabilizer that combines the merits of fuzzy logic and adaptive control is proposed. The stabilizer is essentially a direct adaptive controller. The controller inputs are the speed and generated-power deviations. The control output is a feedback signal which is a weighted sum of fuzzy bases. The weights are obtained using a projection algorithm. The design steps of the proposed stabilizer are explained. Simulation results illustrate the effect of the controller tuning-parameters and compare the adaptive fuzzy-logic stabilizer with the conventional power system stabilizer.

"The unstiffened steel plate shear wall (SPSW) system has emerged as a promising lateral load resisting system in recent years. However, seismic code provisions for these systems are still based on elastic force-based design methodologies. Considering the ever-increasing demands of efficient and reliable design procedures, a shift towards performance-based seismic design (PBSD) procedure is proposed in this work. The proposed PBSD procedure for SPSW systems is based on a target inelastic drift and pre-selected yield mechanism. This design procedure is simple, yet it aims at an advanced design criterion. The proposed procedure is tested on a four-story test building with different steel panel aspect ratios for different target drifts under selected strong motion scenarios. The designs are checked under the selected ground motion scenarios through nonlinear response-history analyses. The actual inelastic drift demands are found to be close to the selected target drifts. In addition, the displacement profiles at peak responses are also compared with the selected yield mechanism. Future modifications required for this design procedure for different SPSW configurations are identified based on these test cases.","Plastic design, Yield mechanism, Steel plate shear walls, Performance-based seismic design, Displacement-based design"
"This paper studies the monopolist's dynamic pricing strategy when introducing successive generations of a durable product. We show that when consumers are semi-anonymous or exactly identified and the innovation is minor, the firm always offers an upgrade discount to former customers. However, the discount depends only on the quality of the old product. In contrast, for moderate and major innovations, the discount depends on the qualities and costs of both the old and the new products. The market growth rate affects the firm's pricing strategy only if consumers are anonymous; furthermore, the effect on prices depends on the discount rate and whether the market growth rate is high or low. For minor innovations, social welfare is maximized if consumers are anonymous. An interesting and paradoxical result is that, when innovations are moderate or major and consumers are semi-anonymous or exactly identified, price discrimination can actually lead to higher social welfare.","product obsolescence, dynamic pricing, innovation, social welfare, sequential product introduction, upgrade policy, price discrimination"
"To examine racial differences in the age at which Medicaid-eligible children first receive an autistic disorder (AD) diagnosis and to examine time in mental health treatment until an AD diagnosis was received.Philadelphia Medicaid specialty mental health claims identified 406 children who received services in 1999 for AD. Claims from 1993-1999 were used to identify the date of first mental health visit, first receipt of AD diagnosis, and number of visits occurring between those dates. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship among race, age at first diagnosis of AD, time in mental health treatment, and number of visits until the diagnosis was made.On average, white children received the AD diagnosis at 6.3 years of age, compared with 7.9 years for black children (p <.001). White children entered the mental health system at an earlier age (6.0 versus 7.1 years, p =.005); however, after adjusting for age, sex, and time eligible for Medicaid, black children required more time in treatment before receiving the diagnosis.Important disparities exist in the early detection and treatment of autism. These disparities may be the result of differences in help-seeking, advocacy and support, and clinician behaviors.","health disparities, children's mental health services, medicaid, autistic disorder, mental health"
"With the development of High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission, the impact of DC system on AC relay protection becomes more prominent. So it becomes more important to research electrical characteristics of AC system under DC faults. In PSCAD/EMTDC environment, the inverter commutation failure resulted from short circuit faults in AC line is simulated based on the electromagnetic transient model of Shandong grid containing Ningdong-Shandong DC transmission system. Prony algorithm is applied to analyze the electrical transient characteristics of AC system during commutation failure. The coincidence of fitted waveform and simulated waveform verified the validity of prony algorithm. Prony analysis results show that DC system injects a large number of inter-harmonic components into the inverter side AC system during commutation failure, and the distortion of the parallel line current is more serious than that of the fault line current, so the impact of DC system on the AC relay protection devices equipped on the parallel line is greater.","high voltage direct current transmission, ningdong-shandong grid dc transmission system, short circuit fault, hvdc commutation failure, short-circuit currents, power system transients, electromagnetic transient model, electrical transient characteristic, power transmission faults, pscad-emtdc environment, inter-harmonic, hvdc power transmission, electrical transient characteristics, prony algorithm, hvdc, prony analysis, commutation, power grids, invertors, interharmonic component, inverter commutation failure, ac relay protection, commutation failure, harmonic analysis, algorithm design and analysis"

"The reliability of communication software is desirable to meet the availability requirement of the associated communication services. Failures in the software implementing the communication protocol may result in unpredictable costs and penalties. In the past, reliability and recovery techniques for communication software have been proposed, but almost all of them are based on intrusive checkpointing procedures, which are invoked periodically. We present an efficient recovery algorithm, which, when incorporated in the protocol design, yields a protocol that can tolerate multiple concurrent failures. The fault tolerance of the recovery algorithm is achieved in two ways: the recovery algorithm can recover from multiple concurrent failures with minimum penalty, and it can recover from failures occurring during the recovery process itself. The recovery algorithm described is based on the concept of event indices and maximally reachable event tuples. During normal operation of the protocol, the state information required for a recovery is piggy-backed with the normal protocol messages. As a result, no overhead in checkpointing is introduced while executing the protocol. Our algorithm requires minimal rollback in case of failure and can handle multiple concurrent failures. A detailed discussion and an example are presented.","communication protocol, concurrent failure, normal operator, fault tolerant"
"We present the results of 100 consecutive magnetic resonance (MR)-guided biopsies in cases where computerised tomography (CT) guiding was considered dangerous or impossible.MR guiding was preferred to CT guiding for cases where lesions were located in the central area, or were not clearly visible on CT scan, or where the visualization of vessels was considered necessary. For most of the patients, calculation of target co-ordinates was performed using dedicated software enabling trajectory previsualization. There were 62 cases of contrast enhanced lesions, 32 cases of lesions without contrast enhancement, and 6 cases of very small lesions appearing hyperintense on T2-weighted images.Biopsies allowed a histological diagnosis in 92 cases. In 8 cases, the biopsy was negative (necrosis, gliosis or normal brain tissue). Three patients had a transient worsening of their neurological disturbances. Two patient had a non-regressive loss of motor function. No patient died.MR guiding for stereotactic biopsies was effective for CT-invisible or ill-defined lesions, lesions located in functional or densely vascularized areas and in the brain stem. The rate of postoperative complications was equivalent to or less than that reported in series of CT-guided biopsies.","Keywords: Stereotaxy, stereotactic procedures, magnetic resonance imaging, biopsy."
"This paper concerns the behaviour of bridge girder webs subjected to concentrated forces that are introduced in the web during launching, a load case usually referred to as patch loading. So far, this type of loading has, in engineering practice, been dealt with using formulas originating from investigations concerning the ultimate load carrying capacity. Numerous bridge launchings have, however, led to unwanted damages of the girder web, i.e. plastic deformations of such magnitudes that the webs had to be repaired. To avoid these damages it is necessary to have a design method, for launching situations, which focuses more on avoiding some irreversible behaviour than on the ultimate load carrying capacity. Such a design method has to be based on a deeper understanding of the behaviour of the girder. In Ref. [1] the first author discusses the fact that yielding of the flange occurs only after the web plate has been severely damaged. This paper describes the deformation behaviour of the web plate due to patch loading. For small loads the deformations will be similar to the first linear buckling mode. As the load increases a smaller buckle, in the opposite direction, will start to develop in the web plate close to the load. This behaviour, which may be named post-critical buckling, occurs also for girders of a perfectly elastic material. The investigations are based on laboratory tests and non-linear finite element analyses of three typical girders representing different slenderness categories.","patch loading, finite element analysis, behaviour, post buckling, design method, carrying capacity, plastic deformation"
"This study investigates whether bank managers use their discretion in estimating loan loss provisions (LLP) to convey information about their banks' future prospects. Bank managers' propensities to signal their private information vary cross sectionally because they face different conditions and have different incentives. This study hypothesizes that the propensity to signal varies negatively with bank size and positively with earnings variability, future investment opportunities, and degree of income smoothing. The empirical evidence supports these predictions. It suggests that the propensity to signal is positively related to the degree of information asymmetry and that bank managers attenuate perceived undervaluation of their banks by communicating their private information about their banks' favorable future prospects.","signaling, earnings variability, income smoothing, investment opportunity set, loan loss provision"
"ocalization of signaling complexes to specific micro- domains coordinates signal transduction at the plasma membrane. Using immunogold electron microscopy of plasma membrane sheets coupled with spatial point pattern analysis, we have visualized morphologically featureless microdomains, including lipid rafts, in situ and at high resolution. We find that an inner-plasma membrane lipid raft marker displays cholesterol-dependent clustering in microdomains with a mean diameter of 44 nm that occupy 35% of the cell surface. Cross-linking an outer-leaflet raft protein results in the redistribution of inner leaflet rafts, but they retain their modular structure. Analysis of Ras L microlocalization shows that inactive H-ras is distributed between lipid rafts and a cholesterol-independent micro- domain. Conversely, activated H-ras and K-ras reside predominantly in nonoverlapping, cholesterol-independent microdomains. Galectin-1 stabilizes the association of activated H-ras with these nonraft microdomains, whereas K-ras clustering is supported by farnesylation, but not geranylgeranylation. These results illustrate that the inner plasma membrane comprises a complex mosaic of discrete microdomains. Differential spatial localization within this framework can likely account for the distinct signal outputs from the highly homologous Ras proteins.","lipid rafts, statistical analysis., electron microscopy, cholesterol, immunogold, point pattern analysis, statistical analysis, high resolution, h ras, signal transduction, lipid raft, receptor, structure analysis, domains, immunohistochemistry, cell biology, membrane proteins, caveolae"

It documents new evidence about the anomaly of insider purchases rather than sales prior to Chapter 11 bankruptcy announcements. Insiders of Chapter 11 bankruptcy firms purchase significantly fewer shares than insiders of the control firms before the bankruptcy announcement. Although insider trading volume declines long before the announcement, the decline is statistically significant only during the 3-month period before the announcement. The study, however, finds no significant difference in trading behavior between insiders of firms that ceased to trade on and those that continue to trade on the NYSE/AMEX within 5 years after the bankruptcy announcements.","insider trading, chapter 11 bankruptcy, nyse/amex, stock exchange, statistical significance"
"Differentiation into castes and reproductive division of labour are a characteristics of eusocial insects. Caste determination occurs at an early stage of larval development in social bees and is achieved via differential nutrition irrespective of the genotype. Workers are usually subordinate to the queen and altruistically refrain from reproduction. Workers of the Cape honeybee (Apis mellifera capensis) do not necessarily refrain from reproduction. They have the unique ability to produce female offspring parthenogenetically (thelytoky) and can develop into 'pseudoqueens'. Although these are morphologically workers, they develop a queen-like phenotype with respect to physiology and behaviour. Thelytoky is determined by a single gene (th) and we show that this gene also influences other traits related to the queen phenotype, including egg production and queen pheromone synthesis. Using 566 microsatellite markers, we mapped this gene to chromosome 13 and identified a candidate locus thelytoky, similar to grainy head (a transcription factor), which has been shown to be highly expressed in queens of eusocial insects. We therefore suggest that this gene is not only important for determining the pseudoqueen phenotype in A. m. capensis workers, but is also of general importance in regulating the gene cascades controlling reproduction and sterility in female social bees.","sterilization, division of labour, pleiotropy, parthenogenesis, transcription factor, thelytoky, lod score, gene expression regulation"
"In light of recent reports of sudden death in children being treated with desipramine (DMI), 3 of which were associated with physical exercise, the authors examined the effects of DMI on exercise in children and adults before and during DMI treatment.Before treatment, 22 subjects (9 children, 13 adults) participated in a graded treadmill exercise test. Outcome measures included exercise tolerance, cardiovascular, and electrocardiographic parameters at progressive intensity levels and serum norepinephrine (NE) levels before and after exercise testing. Subjects were then treated with DMI, titrated to an average DMI dosage of 3 mg/kg, and underwent repeated exercise testing.DMI treatment was associated with a significant elevation of circulating NE levels in the pre-exercise assessment. Exercise tolerance was not affected by DMI, and blood pressure and heart rate effects were modest. The cardiovascular impact of DMI treatment was similar in children and adults. One 31-year-old subject exhibited a brief episode of ventricular tachycardia associated with exercise during DMI treatment.DMI has only minor effects on the cardiovascular response to exercise, and these effects do not appear age-related. However, DMI may increase the risk of exercise-associated arrhythmias in rare individuals.","norepinephrine, exercise testing, arrhythmias, tricyclic antidepressants, desipramine, physical exercise"
"Several Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels (VGSC) are widely expressed on lymphocytes and macrophages but their role in immune function is still debated.

These effects may be mediated by the reduced intracellular Na(+) levels, which in turn may impair the activity of Na(+)/Ca(++) exchanger resulting in reduced intracellular Ca(++) levels during lymphocyte activation. Furthermore, in Jurkat cell line VGSC appear to be involved in cell volume regulation, migration in artificial matrix and cell death by apoptosis. VGSC play a role in macrophage function as well, and VGSC blockers impair both phagocytosis and inflammatory responses. Several VGSC blockers have shown immunomodulatory properties in mice models, skewing the immune response toward a Th2-mediated response, while suppressing Th1-mediated responses, and VGSC already used in clinical practice are known to modulate immunoglobulin (Ig) levels both in mice and in humans. These effects suggest that VGSC blockers may find clinical application in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disease. However, many of these drugs induce a number of severe side effects. The relevance of VGSC function in immune regulation suggest that the testing of newly patented VGSC blockers for their effect on immunity may be worthwhile.","antibody isotypes, immunomodulation, t-helper 2 cells, voltage-gated sodium channel., phenytoin, immune response, cell death, immunoglobulin, voltage gated sodium channel, cell line, immune function, side effect"
"Non-real-time services are an important category of network services in future wireless networks. When mobile users access non-real-time services, mobile users are usually concerned with the total time to complete their data transfer. In addition, system providers expect that channel utilization should be as high as possible because radio channels are limited. Therefore, it is crucial to design a system that satisfies the total completion time requirement of mobile users while maximizes channel utilization. In this paper, we design an optimal call admission control scheme that uses two thresholds; one threshold is used to determine whether or not to accept a new call arrival into a cell, and the other threshold is used to limit the total number of calls in a cell. An analysis is developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed call admission control scheme. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme not only satisfies mobile users' quality-of-service requirements (in terms of the total completion time and hand-off dropping probability) but also maximizes channel utilization.","Admission control, Non-real-time services, Wireless data networks, Quality-of-service, Radio resource management"
"To investigate the characteristics of imported Katayama fever (acute schistosomiasis) as well as evolution and outcome under treatment.Between April 2000 and September 2004, we included prospectively all patients with confirmed diagnosis of Katayama fever. Follow-up was maintained at least until 6 months after symptoms resolved. Praziquantel (PZQ) was given as soon as the diagnosis was probable, most of the time with steroids.Twenty-three patients were diagnosed with Katayama fever by Schistosoma egg detection and/or by seroconversion. Clinical features were non-specific, with mainly respiratory and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. Diagnosis was confirmed at presentation in 17/23 (74%) patients, of whom 15 by serology. Immediate clinical exacerbation occurred in five of nine patients not given steroids concomitantly with PZQ. After initial resolution, fever recurred in five (22%) patients. When compiling initial and recurrent episodes (n=28), respiratory symptoms tended to occur at an earlier stage after exposure, while abdominal complaints were more frequent later. All patients were completely cured, sometimes after repeated treatments.Clinical presentation of Katayama fever is non-specific and involves respiratory and abdominal symptoms. Recurrence of fever is not unusual despite anti-helminthic treatment. Optimal therapeutic strategy remains to be defined to prevent recurrence.","katayama, eosinophilia, africa, schistosomiasis, praziquantel, traveller"
"The effects of anticholinesterase preparations and cholinolytics on the potentials of the midbrain tectum evoked by stimulation of the optic tract and the opposite hemisphere were investigated in experiments on the perfused isolatedRana temporaria head. Low concentrations of galanthamine and eserine intensify the first and second postsynaptic components of the evoked potentials connected with the activation of both myelinated and unmyelinated fibers, and in higher concentration, first increase, and then reversibly inhibit them. Amisyl, depending on the concentration, partially or completely blocks both components and these effects are also reversible. Gangleron does not have an effect on the evoked potentials. A clear antagonism was found between anticholinesterase compounds and amisyl. After tetanic stimulation of both optic nerves simultaneously, a substance of acetylcholine nature appears in the perfusate. This makes it possible to assume that the optic terminals in the midbrain tectum form cholinergic synapses and that the corresponding postsynaptic structures contain cholineroreceptors of the muscarine type. Some differences in the dynamics of the changes in the first and second postsynaptic components from the effect of both galanthamine and eserine, as well as amisyl, indicate higher sensitivity of synaptic systems which consist of unmyelinated optic fibers. In contrast to the optic terminals, the transcommissural links do not form cholinergic synapses and anticholinesterase and cholinolytic substances do not have an effect on the transcommissural potentials.","Acetylcholine, Optic Nerve, Optic Fiber, Chemical Specificity, Optic Tract"
"In this exploratory research, a value-chain analysis is used to investigate how industrial suppliers working with the European Research Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN) gain benefits resulting from technological innovation. The results suggest that while the impact of contracts with CERN on suppliers' short-term value-chain activities were negative, their effect on marketing and technology development activities were positive in cases where suppliers entered the contract with preexisting strategic goals linked to their core competencies.","value chain, knowledge transfer, core competencies, particle physics"
"Centrioles are duplicated once in every cell cycle, ensuring the bipolarity of the mitotic spindle. Although the core components have been identified, how they cooperate to achieve high fidelity in centriole duplication remains poorly understood. Here, we show that in centriole duplication the accumulation of STIL and HsSAS6, components of the cartwheel structure, provides negative feedback in the centriolar dynamics of Plk4. By live-cell imaging of endogenously tagged proteins in human cells throughout the entire cell cycle, we quantitatively tracked the dynamics of the critical duplication factors: Plk4, STIL, and HsSAS6. Centriolar Plk4 peaks and then starts decreasing during the late G1 phase, which coincides with the accumulation of STIL at centrioles. Shortly thereafter, the HsSAS6 level increases steeply at the procentriole assembly site. We also show that both STIL and HsSAS6 are necessary for attenuating Plk4 levels. Furthermore, our mathematical modeling and simulation convincingly reproduce the dynamics of these three proteins at centrioles, and suggest that the STIL-HsSAS6 complex in the cartwheel has a negative feedback effect on centriolar Plk4. Combined, these findings illustrate how the dynamic behavior of and interactions between the critical duplication factors coordinate the centriole-duplication process.","CRISPR-Cas9, Centriole duplication, Live imaging, Mathematical modeling"
"Abnormalities of the thyroid axis are documented in adult mood disorders. The most consistent findings have been observed in major depressive disorder with elevations of thyroxine (T4) or free-T4 (fT4) within the euthyroid range that decrease with treatment. The literature on adolescents is limited, and it is unknown whether similar findings might be present in this population.First admissions to a university hospital adolescent psychiatry unit were reviewed. Fourteen depressed and 13 manic patients satisfied inclusion and exclusion criteria. None had a history of thyroid illness or medical illness or were taking medications known to affect thyroid function. Basal serum thyrotropin, T4, fT4, triiodothyronine (T3), reverse-T3, free thyroxine index (FTI), and T3 resin uptake levels were compared with those of a group of adolescent normal controls.T4 (but not fT4) was elevated in depressed and manic patients compared with controls (p < .05). In manic patients, T3 was decreased and reverse-T3 was increased (p < .05). There were no significant differences in relation to age, sex, or suicidality.We observed significant differences in basal thyroid hormone levels in depressed and manic adolescents. Our results suggest the presence of abnormalities of thyroid function in adolescent mood disorders similar to those described in mood-disordered adults.","adolescent, thyroid, bipolar disorder, depression"
"The high cost of software maintenance could be reduced by automatically improving the design of object-oriented programs without altering their behaviour. We have constructed a software tool capable of refactoring object-oriented programs to conform more closely to a given design quality model, by formulating the task as a search problem in the space of alternative designs. This novel approach is validated by two case studies, where programs are automatically refactored to increase flexibility, reusability and understandability as defined by a contemporary quality model. Both local and simulated annealing searches were found to be effective in this task.","object-oriented program, search-based refactoring, alternative design, contemporary quality model, refactoring, design quality model, high cost, search-based software engineering, case study, automated design improvement, software maintenance, novel approach, software tool, search problem, search based software engineering, simulated annealing, object oriented programming"
"The long-term effects of prenatal stress (three times daily restraint stress during the last week of gestation) on the behavioral response to stress, as assessed by novelty-induced locomotion, performance in the forced swim test, and the acquisition of a two-way active avoidance, were investigated in two inbred strains of rats, Fischer 344 (F344/NHsd/Zur) and Lewis (LEW/SsNHsd/Zur). Additional measures included birth weights, pain threshold on the hot plate, and basal and stress-induced corticosterone secretion. In all of the behavioral paradigms strain differences were found: LEW rats showed poorer acquisition of avoidance conditioning, displayed higher levels of activity on the open plate, less immobility time in the forced swim test, and lower pain thresholds in the hot-plate test compared with F344 rats. LEW rats had higher birth weights after prenatal stress, whereas F344 rats were lighter. Following prenatal stress the pattern of behavioral effects obtained in LEW rats in stress-related tests could be interpreted as improved coping abilities with stress, i.e., improved acquisition of active avoidance, less immobility in the forced swim test, and reduced novelty-induced locomotion. Prenatal stress was much less effective in inducing long-term behavioral changes in F344 rats, yielding only one effect, namely, enhanced novelty-induced locomotion in female F344 rats. Pain thresholds were increased as a consequence of prenatal stress, irrespective of strain and gender. Basal and stress-induced corticosterone release differed in the two strains, with LEW rats showing less stress-induced corticosterone release. Prenatal stress did not, however, affect basal or stress-induced corticosterone release. The results suggest that prenatal stress exerts long-term effects on behavior, which depend on the genetic background.","gender differences, prenatal stress, fischer rat, lewis rat, genetic differences, hpa system, birth weight, genetics, behavior change, forced swim test, inbred strain, pain threshold"
"Root cause analyses show that up to 70 % of adverse events are caused by human error. Strong non-technical skills (NTS) can prevent or reduce these errors, considerable numbers of which occur in the operating theatre. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) requires manipulation of more complex equipment than open procedures, likely requiring a different set of NTS for each kind of team. The aims of this study were to identify the MIS teams' key NTS and investigate the effect of training and assessment of NTS on MIS teams.The databases of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, PsycINFO, and Scopus were systematically searched according to Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Articles containing outcome measures related to MIS teams' key NTS, training, or assessment of NTS were included.The search yielded 1984 articles, 11 of which were included. All were observational studies without blinding, and they differed in aims, types of evaluation, and outcomes. Only two studies evaluated patient outcomes other than operative time, and overall, the studies' quality of evidence was low. Different communication types were encountered in MIS compared to open surgery, mainly due to equipment- and patient-related challenges. Fixed teams improved teamwork and safety levels, while deficient planning and poor teamwork were found to obstruct workflow and increase errors. Training NTS mitigates these issues and improves staff attitudes towards NTS.MIS teams' NTS are important for workflow and prevention of errors and can be enhanced by working in fixed teams. In the technological complex sphere of MIS, communication revolves around equipment- and patient-related topics, much more so than in open surgery. In all, only a few heterogeneous-design studies have examined this. In the future, the focus should shift to systematically identifying key NTS and developing effective, evidence-based team training programmes in MIS.","Assessment tools, Errors, Minimally invasive surgery, Non-technical skills, Operating room, Team training"
"This paper reports on the role users played in the design and development of an electronic patient record. Two key users participated in the project team. All future users received questionnaires and a selection of them was interviewed. Before starting the development of the EPR, the attitude of users towards electronic record keeping, their satisfaction with the paper clinical records, their knowledge of computers, and their needs and expectations of computer applications in health care were measured by means of a questionnaire. The results of the questionnaire were supplemented with in-depth interviews. Users had a neutral attitude towards electronic record keeping. They were more positive about data entry of the paper records than data retrieval. During the development phase, but prior to the implementation of the EPR, a second questionnaire measured satisfaction with the paper records. Satisfaction appeared to be related to self-rated computer experience. Inexperienced computer users tended to be more positive about the paper records. In general, respondents did not have many expectations about electronic record keeping. A second series of interviews zoomed in on the expectations users had. Except for more concise reporting no beneficial effects of electronic record keeping were expected.","software design, data retrieval, questionnaires, computer experiment, interviews, health care"
"Reuse of ontologies is important for achieving better interoperability among health systems and relieving knowledge engineers from the burden of developing ontologies from scratch. Most of the work that aims to facilitate ontology reuse has focused on building ontology libraries that are simple repositories of ontologies or has led to keyword-based search tools that search among ontologies. To our knowledge, there are no operational methodologies that allow users to evaluate ontologies and to compare them in order to choose the most appropriate ontology for their task. In this paper, we present, Knowledge Zone - a Web-based portal that allows users to submit their ontologies, to associate metadata with their ontologies, to search for existing ontologies, to find ontology rankings based on user reviews, to post their own reviews, and to rate reviews.","commissioning, academic research, knowledge management, publishing"
"The increasing adoption of service oriented architectures across different administrative domains, forces service providers to use effective mechanisms and strategies of resource management in order for them to be able to guarantee the quality levels their customers demands during service provisioning. Service level agreements (SLA) are the most common mechanism used to establish agreements on the quality of a service (QoS) between a service provider and a service consumer. The WS-Agreement specification, developed by the Open Grid Forum, is a Web Service protocol to establish agreements on the QoS level to be guaranteed in the provision of a service. The committed agreement cannot be modified during service provision and is effective until all activities pertaining to it are finished or until one of the signing party decides to terminate it. In B2B scenarios where several service providers are involved in the composition of a service, and each of them plays both the parts of provider and customer, several one-to-one SLAs need to be signed. In such a rigid context the global QoS of the final service can be strongly affected by any violation on each single SLA. In order to prevent such violations, SLAs need to adapt to any possible needs that might come up during service provision. In this work we focus on the WS-Agreement specification and propose to enhance the flexibility of its approach. We integrate new functionality to the protocol that enable the parties of a WS-Agreement to re-negotiate and modify its terms during the service provision, and show how a typical scenario of service composition can benefit from our proposal.","soa, service consumer, service provider, service provision, service composition, service level agreement, forces service provider, dynamic slas management, qos level, grid, final service, global qos, negotiation, ws-agreement specification, service level agreement (sla), web service, service oriented architecture"
"Information systems fail for a number of reasons. Several failure reasons include communication, complexity, organization, technology, and leadership. Failure can be outlined in four major categories: technical shortcomings, project management shortcomings, organizational issues, and the continuing information explosion. Change management is the process of assisting individuals and organizations in passing from an old way of doing things to a new way of doing things. Change management starts early in a technical process, as the need for making major changes starts at the conceptual level. This paper briefly covers the people side of implementing new information systems, and describes resistance to change and various strategies to manage technological change.","him, change management, health information management, strategies for success, is, implementation, organizational issues, information systems, information system, technological change, communication complexity"
"The treatment options for complicated appendicitis in children continue to evolve. Optimal management of complicated appendicitis relies on an accurate preoperative diagnosis. We examined the accuracy of our preoperative diagnosis including computed tomography (CT) and the influence on the management of children with perforated and nonperforated appendicitis.Following IRB approval, a 6-year review of all patients that underwent an appendectomy for suspected appendicitis was performed. Treatments included immediate operations and initial nonoperative management (antibiotic therapy +/- percutaneous drainage of abscess). Appendicitis was confirmed by histological examination.One thousand seventy-eight patients underwent appendectomy for suspected appendicitis. Preoperative CT scans were performed in 697 (64.7%) patients: 615 (88.2%) positive for appendicitis; 42 (6.0%) negative; and 40 (5.7%) equivocal. One hundred seventy-three (28.1%) positive CT scans further suggested perforation. Initial nonoperative management was initiated in 39 (22.5%) cases of suspected perforated appendicitis with abscess. The positive-predictive value (PPV) for suspected acute appendicitis based on history and physical examination alone was 90.8%. The PPV for positive CT scan for acute appendicitis was 96.4% with a PPV of 91.9% for positive CT scan for perforated appendicitis.The correct preoperative diagnosis of appendicitis appears statistically more accurate with CT scan compared to history and physical examination alone (PPV 96.4% versus 90.8%, P = 0.045). For those with clinically suspicious complicated appendicitis, CT evaluation may direct therapy toward initial nonoperative management. The efficacy of this regimen warrants further investigation.","perforated appendicitis, pediatric, acute appendicitis, ct scan, interval appendectomy, retrospective studies"
"Due to electromagnetic silence, passive tracking systems for emitter targets usually produce track segments (i.e., tracklets) rather than an entire trajectory of the target. Therefore, a multi-stage method for emitter target tracking is proposed in this paper. In the stage of tracklet generation, the GM-PHD tracker with adaptive estimation of target birth intensity is applied to generate reliable tracklets of the emitter targets. After that, in the stage of tracklet association, the multi-point motion information and emitter signal information are integrated to compute the similarities between the tracklets. The affinity propagation algorithm, which does not impose the constraint of one-to-one correspondence, is then used to cluster the tracklets. In the stage of association refining, the clustering result is adjusted to refine the final trajectories according to the spatial-temporal constraint of the tracklets. The simulation results show that the proposed method is robust and performs well.","gm-phd filter, tracklet association, affinity propagation, emitter target tracking, radar tracking, sensors, trajectory, clustering algorithms"
"Summary Selection of sites for oviposition when the risk of predation by green frogs was variable studied in tandems of the damselfly Pyrrhosoma nymphula. In the absence of predators the number of tandems landing increased with the size of the oviposition site and with the number of pairs already present. Pairs approaching an oviposition site landed promptly and preferred locations near other ovipositing pairs. Pairs which had landed near others left the landing site and flew to another water plant after a shorter period than those landing alone. They stayed in groups for only 16.5% of the total duration of stay at the oviposition site. With predators present fewer tandems landed. There was no relationship between the landing site of solitary tandems and the locations of the perching frogs. Pairs landing in groups were disturbed by frogs after a shorter period than pairs landing alone. Damselfly aggregation did not affect the predation success of the frogs, but the predation risk to individual tandem pairs was reduced.","Aggregation, Oviposition site selection, Predator avoidance, Pyrrhosoma nymphula"
"The use of cold-formed thin-walled steel profiles in seismic structures is nowadays strongly penalized by code prescriptions, which impose for this kind of members a q-factor equal to 1, so that the design for the action of a severe earthquake must be carried out practically in the elastic field. On the other hand, some theoretical studies on the seismic performance of such structural systems gave encouraging results. For these reasons, an experimental and theoretical research program on the behaviour of cold-formed members loaded by cyclic loads has been started in the recent past by the authors. In the first phase of the experimental program, tests in bending on coupled channel beams under monotonic and cyclic load have been carried out. In this paper the research program is described, the obtained results are presented and some preliminary consideration is made on the behaviour of these types of members.","thin-walled profiles, monotonic loading, cold-formed profiles, cyclic loading, coupled channel beams, experimental tests"
"The first proteomic analysis of the respiratory pathogen Legionella pneumophila ATCC 33152 is presented in this report. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of total cell extracts was carried out. In total, 130 protein spots were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) or by quadruple time-of-flight tandem MS, including proteins correlated with virulence. For the first time, proteins of L. pneumophila were identified using mass spectrometric methods and mapped on a two-dimensional gel; this will be of considerable use for comparison of protein expression profiles of L. pneumophila wild-type and knock-out mutant strains and of L. pneumophila grown under different conditions.","legionella pneumophila, q-tof ms/ms, proteomics, maldi-tof ms, proteome map, time of flight, maldi tof ms, time of flight mass spectrometry, genome sequence, protein expression, wild type, two dimensional gel electrophoresis"
"LINE-1 constitutes an important component of mammalian genomes. It has a dynamic evolutionary history characterized by the rise, fall and replacement of subfamilies. Most data concerning LINE-1 biology and evolution are derived from the human and mouse genomes and are often assumed to hold for all placentals.To examine LINE-1 relationships, sequences from the 3' region of the reverse transcriptase from 21 species (representing 13 orders across Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Supraprimates and Laurasiatheria) were obtained from whole genome sequence assemblies, or by PCR with degenerate primers. These sequences were aligned and analysed.Our analysis reflects accepted placental relationships suggesting mostly lineage-specific LINE-1 families. The data provide clear support for several clades including Glires, Supraprimates, Laurasiatheria, Boreoeutheria, Xenarthra and Afrotheria. Within the afrotherian LINE-1 (AfroLINE) clade, our tree supports Paenungulata, Afroinsectivora and Afroinsectiphillia. Xenarthran LINE-1 (XenaLINE) falls sister to AfroLINE, providing some support for the Atlantogenata (Xenarthra+Afrotheria) hypothesis.LINEs and SINEs make up approximately half of all placental genomes, so understanding their dynamics is an essential aspect of comparative genomics. Importantly, a tree of LINE-1 offers a different view of the root, as long edges (branches) such as that to marsupials are shortened and/or broken up. Additionally, a robust phylogeny of diverse LINE-1 is essential in testing that site-specific LINE-1 insertions, often regarded as homoplasy-free phylogenetic markers, are indeed unique and not convergent.","phylogeny, reverse transcriptase, genome sequence, genome, comparative genomics"

"Smith chart conversion of complex numbers from rectangular form to polar form, and vice versa, often involves the construction of one or more constant magnitude circular arcs. If the magnitude is being sought, it is frequently necessary to resort to graphical interpolation between the arcs. In any event, should the magnitude, given or desired, be between approximately one-fourth and four, the centers of the constant magnitude arcs inconveniently lie off the conventional Smith chart. This paper presents geometric methods with brief proofs for keeping all magnitude constructions on the commercial chart and for increasing the accuracy of results by referring interpolations to the accurately printed scalings on the horizontal axis.","rectangular form, commercial chart, constant magnitude, brief proof, conventional Smith chart, Space-Limited Construction, polar form, Smith Chart, circular arc, smith chart conversion, complex number, magnitude construction"
"This paper examines whether the Massachusetts Tobacco Control Program is affecting the rates of smoking and smokeless tobacco use among Massachusetts' youth.School survey data from the Massachusetts Prevalence Study were analyzed to estimate differences between 1993 and 1996 rates of youth cigarette and smokeless tobacco use, attitudes toward smoking, and awareness of cigarette ads and promotions of antismoking messages.Lifetime and Current Smoking rates declined significantly among middle school males, contrasting with stable national trends. Among girls in this age group, Lifetime and Current Smoking did not change significantly. Hispanic middle school students exhibited a significant decline in Lifetime Use. There were no significant changes in Lifetime or Current Smoking rates among high school students. Lifetime use of smokeless tobacco declined among middle school students while Current Use declined among both middle and high school students. Students reported declines in awareness of cigarette ads or promotions and increases in awareness of antismoking messages.These results provide evidence for cautious optimism regarding the impact of tobacco control, but indicate that these efforts should begin earlier and that additional research is needed to understand and address the problems of tobacco use by girls.","tobacco trends, smoking attitudes, smokeless tobacco, tobacco control, smoking, youth smoking., tobacco advertising, age groups, survey data"

"High performance steel (HPS) is rapidly gaining attention as a desirable material for highway bridge girders largely due to its superior toughness properties and high strength. However, the benefits of using steels with nominal yield strengths of 485 MPa (70 ksi) or greater is restricted by factors such as web stability, deflection, and fatigue design limits, which may govern the design and prevent the effective utilization of the material strength. Therefore, new and innovative bridge design concepts are needed to take better advantage of the enhanced properties of HPS. One design innovation that provides a means of optimizing bridge girders for high strength material utilizes I-girders with double web plates. The web is composed of two steel face plates connected internally by continuous longitudinal stiffening elements. The voids between the face plates may be grouted or ungrouted. The stiffeners permit thin webs to be used, while still allowing the material to reach stresses as high as the yield strength without buckling. In the case of grouted webs, composite behavior increases the out-of-plane stiffness of the web, although bond between the two materials may be unreliable. Nevertheless, it is shown that even in a debonded state, the presence of the grout enhances the buckling capacity of the face plates significantly. Using classical plate buckling theory, design criteria are proposed for bend buckling of the web face plates, considering both the grouted and ungrouted cases. As a means of assessing the anticipated behavior of the plates, upper and lower bounds to the buckling strengths are established. In order to evaluate the ability of classical plate theory to predict the buckling of the face plates, tests were conducted on a series of web panels that simulate a portion of a girder web subjected to flexural compressive stresses. Two of the specimens were ungrouted, two were grouted with a cementitious material, and one was grouted with an epoxy grout. It was confirmed that the presence of grout increased the buckling capacity of the face plates and that the improved bond using epoxy grout served to delay buckling as well, although when the bond broke the failure was sudden. The experimentally determined buckling loads are used to validate the theory.","higher performance steel, grout, stiffener, bridges, web, plate, girder, stability, local buckling, upper and lower bounds, yield strength"
"As a result of the lack of basic microscopic anatomy of the elephants' foot, this study deals with the normal microscopic morphology of both the Asian (Elephas maximus) and African (Loxodonta africana) elephant foot with consideration of pathologic changes. A total of 727 histologic samples from defined locations of 24 hooves of both species (17 Asian and seven African species) were studied, measured, and evaluated. Minor differences between the feet and species are seen histologically. Poor horn quality in captive elephants' hooves and loci of minor resistance in captive and wild animals are detected. The thickness of the weight-bearing surface of the captive elephants' hooves is histologically measured as ""very thin"" (about 10 mm). The normal histologic findings provide a basis for assessing histopathologic changes and especially horn quality. The histologic findings might explain some of the foot problems, but they also give rise to questions about the quality and correctness of current husbandry techniques.","histopathology, wild animals, morphology, feet, histology"

"The purpose of this article is to explore the need for the possibility to reconstruct electronic medical data, in particular the electronic health record (EHR) as they have been or could have been presented to a specified health care professional at a specified moment in the past. The approach taken is that first the need for such functionality is discussed with attention to the differences between electronic records and paper records in this respect. Next the architectural and technical consequences of the implementation of the functionality are considered. The article concludes that such functionality is needed for medical audit, self assessment and handling of complaints. It further concludes that it is far from easy to implement the functionality. If the health care community underwrites the need for such functionality this will have a significant impact on the architecture of medical information systems and the (distributed) EHR. It is recommended that the professional associations and the governments, in collaboration with WHO, take a position on the need to be able to reconstruct the contents of the EHR. IMIA could take the lead in that process.","data presentation, health care, professional association, audit"
"What determines the composition of companies' boards in the context of high ownership concentration? Are independent directors important as an internal governance mechanism in companies with high ownership concentration? Do markets favor companies whose controlling shareholders use voting rights to elect professional directors? Using a four-year, 160-company panel data, and controlling for endogeneity, this paper addresses these three related questions, finding that an increase in the proportion of outside directors affects company value. The paper also finds that companies that present more exacerbated agency conflicts tend to incorporate professional directors to the boards, in an effort to improve corporate governance and ameliorate the agency problem.","corporate governance, boards, emerging economies, chile, ownership structure, panel data, agency problem"

"The min 4 region of the Escherichia coli genome contains genes (lpxA and lpxB) that encode proteins involved in lipid A biosynthesis. We have determined the sequence of 1,350 base pairs of DNA upstream of the lpxB gene. This fragment of DNA contains the complete coding sequence for the 28.0-kilodalton lpxA gene product and an upstream open reading frame capable of encoding a 17-kilodalton protein (ORF17). In addition there appears to be an additional open reading frame (ORF?) immediately upstream of ORF17. The initiation codon for lpxA is a GUG codon, and the start codon for ORF17 is apparently a UUG codon. The start and stop codons overlap between ORF? and ORF17, ORF17 and lpxA, and lpxA and lpxB. This overlap is suggestive of translational coupling and argues that the genes are cotranscribed. Crowell et al. (D.N. Crowell, W.S. Reznikoff, and C.R.H. Raetz, J. Bacteriol. 169:5727-5734, 1987) and Tomasiewicz and McHenry (H.G. Tomasiewicz and C.S. McHenry, J. Bacteriol. 169:5735-5744, 1987) have demonstrated that there are three similarly overlapping coding regions downstream of lpxB including dnaE, suggesting the existence of a complex operon of at least seven genes: 5'-ORF?-ORF17-lpxA-lpxB-ORF23-dnaE-ORF37-3 '.","molecular weight, amino acid sequence, lipid a, codon, escherichia coli"
"Laser Direct Materials Deposition(LDMD) is one of new emerging techniques of Rapid Manufacturing(RM) supported by CAD/CAM in recent years. Although LDMD shows great potential for many industrial applications, low powder efficiency about 30% due to carrying gas increases cost of production and limits its application. In this paper, based on the Beer-Lambert law, the concentration of powder and the beam attenuation in co-axial feed powder laser cladding are researched. The relationship of the attenuation and laser cladding parameters, such as the laser power. A new co-axial powder feeder without carrying gas for LDMD was developed. Preliminary research on LDMD was achieved by non-carrying gas powder feeder.","Cladding, Co-axial, LDMD, Non-carrying gas"
"The investigation stems from a recommendation by Holt that clinicians should have training which makes it possible for them to validate themselves as clinical predictors in much the same way as tests are cross-validated. 3 experiments were devised to provide feedback concerning accuracy of predictions in the expectations that feedback could be used to improve performance. The ""clinicians"" studied were undergraduate students, and the prediction task involved interpretation of short sentence-completion protocols. In all 3 experiments there was evidence for the superior performance of those Ss who received feedback, but the bulk of the evidence suggested that the feedback effect was attributable to enhancement of motivation of the Ss rather than to specific informational value.

"A 28-item questionnaire assessing family values was completed by 191 Vietnamese and 639 Caucasian adolescents in Oklahoma City Public Schools and by about half their parents. Vietnamese refugee parents, regardless of time in the United States, strongly endorsed traditional family values. Vietnamese adolescents tended to reject traditional values. This generation gap increased with time in the United States and was greater for girls than for boys. Despite wholehearted endorsement of traditional family values, Vietnamese parents tended to approve certain adolescent privileges. The results suggest that Vietnamese adolescents may receive conflicting messages from their parents. On the one hand, parents endorsed such traditional values as absolute obedience to parental authority but on the other, they registered relative approval of adolescent freedom of choice regarding dating, marriage, and career. Such ambivalence suggests that Vietnamese refugee families may experience considerable strain while adjusting to American values.","family values, vietnamese refugees, adolescents, attitude survey"
"Analogy-based estimation is a widely adopted problem solving method that has been evaluated and confirmed in software effort or cost estimation domains. The similarity measures between pairs of projects play a critical role in the analogy-based software effort estimation models. Such a model calculates a distance between the software project being estimated and each of the historical software projects, and then retrieves the most similar project for generating an effort estimate. Although there exist numerous analogy-based software effort estimation models in literature, little theoretical or experimental works have been reported on the method of deriving an effort estimate from the adjustment of the reused effort based on the similarity distance. The present paper investigates the effect on the improvement of estimation accuracy in analogy-based estimations when the genetic algorithm method is adopted to adjust reused effort based on the similarity distances between pairs of projects. The empirical results show that applying a suitable linear model to adjust the analogy-based estimations is a feasible approach to improving the accuracy of software effort estimates. It also demonstrates that the proposed model is comparable with those obtained when using other effort estimation methods.","estimation accuracy, software effort estimation, effort estimate, adjusted analogy-based software effort, numerous analogy-based software effort, software project management, effort estimation method, analogy-based estimation, software effort, cost estimation domain, software effort estimate, similarity distance, analogy-based software effort estimation, linear model, genetic algorithm, cost estimation"
"The vasoactive peptide urotensin-II and its receptor, GPR14 (now known as UT receptor), are localised in the mammalian central nervous system. Accordingly, various centrally mediated effects of urotensin-II on behaviour, neuroendocrine hormones and neurochemistry have been described. To investigate neuroanatomical substrates for the central actions of urotensin-II, expression of the immediate early gene c- fos was examined following intracerebroventricular administration to rats. Urotensin-II increased Fos expression in the cingulate cortex and periaqueductal grey, suggesting important central roles for urotensin-II and its receptor.","c- fos, ut receptor, gpr14, urotensin-ii, central nervous system"

"Overactive bladder syndrome (OABS) is a widely recognized syndrome with symptoms that can include urinary urgency, frequency, nocturia, and incontinence. Although there may be several causative factors for OABS, detrusor overactivity is the most common. In addition, urinary incontinence can also be due to a distinct but equally bothersome condition underactive bladder syndrome, or detrusor underactivity. The incomplete bladder emptying that characterizes detrusor underactivity often arises from impaired contractile function of the detrusor muscle. The variations in etiologies of the two syndromes necessitate patient evaluations tailored to individual symptom presentation. Increased awareness of the differences between the manifestations of OABS and underactive bladder syndrome call for specific approaches to the management of bladder dysfunction.","radiology, imaging, nature, urology, pathology"
"Modeling is a fundamental technique for coping with undesirable complexity in constructing and reasoning about software systems. The concept of modeling can be applied to software design and implementation in two ways: a design can be viewed as an abstract model of the system it represents, and designs and implementations may be represented by even more abstract, simplified models for purposes of analysis. A discussion of these concepts and their applications is presented, including a case study showing the use of modeling in the debugging of an actual software system and remarks on research in progress.","software system, abstract model, undesirable complexity, software development, fundamental technique, software design, case study, actual software system"
"This exploratory study examines the conceptual domain of service quality for inpatient nursing services. The findings suggest that the prevailing conceptual definition of service quality, as articulated by Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry (1985, 1988) , does not accurately describe service quality for the customers of inpatient nursing services. A definition of inpatient nursing service quality is provided, and an instrument based on that definition, the Inpatient Nursing Service Quality Scale, is presented. The instrument's construct validity, nomological validity, and reliability are examined, and the findings are favorable. The results of the study reveal that service quality perceptions for hospital inpatients consist of five dimensions: compassion, uncertainty reduction, reliability, close relationships , and individualized care. The dimensions are significant predictors of several outcomes, including global perceptions of service quality, willingness to recommend, and repurchase intentions. It is argued that industry-specific qualitative research should be conducted before using generic service quality measurement tools or instruments developed in other industries.","service quality, exploratory study, qualitative research, construct validity"
"T ARI L AN is a functional programming language, specialized for data processing tasks. Its intended application field is in complex data processing tasks where flexibility is more important than high performance. The flexibility is the result of a separation of the business rules that control the transformation from the transformation itself. The present work shows how a subset of functional and logic programming can be used to express complex transformation rules. The T ARI L AN system is now in use for more than two years and proves to be a powerful environment in practice.","data processing, functional programming, t ari l an, embedded functional data, complex data, functional programming language, business rules"
"The explosion of new technologies is revolutionizing the retail environment. Yet, not all consumers choose to use the new technologies nor do all consumers see these changes as improvements. In this research, we explore usage patterns and benefits of using self-service technologies (SSTs) based on a sample of 823 consumers. We also assess the influence of individual characteristics, specifically technology anxiety (TA) and particular demographics, on SST usage patterns and satisfaction levels. The findings indicate that respondents with higher levels of TA use fewer SSTs and that TA is a better, more consistent predictor of SST usage than are demographic variables. In addition, TA was found to influence overall levels of satisfaction, intentions to use the SST again and the likelihood of participating in positive word-of-mouth for those consumers who had an initially satisfying experience.","self-service technologies, retail technologies, technology anxiety, word of mouth, satisfiability"
"Michael Hulme and Anna Truch's article on 'Interspace', is one in which a new field of social spaces in between the established ones of home, work and social lives is developed. Hulme and Truch argue that the mobility of the device allows what has previously been a transitory space to become a social field in its own right. Following on from spontaneous comments from the subjects in their study, they define this space as increasingly important. In this article, the way in which the mobile phone stretches boundaries of social time and space is explored. This stretching opens up a whole new territory, which becomes a place of negotiation that exists in the travels the individual subject makes between the more formalised spaces. Hulme and Truch define this space as one of transition between estab- lished, more formalised fields; one of overlapping fields--in interspace the indi- vidual is juggling roles from a variety of social fields.","Mobile Phone, Travel Time, Social Identity, Field Boundary, Voice Call"
"This paper develops a ride dynamics model and presents a method to apply a linear robust control and fuzzy logic control to a high mobility off-road tracked vehicle. To avoid the complexity of modeling track system, it is classified as unknown dynamics and disturbances. At first, a nonlinear off-road tracked vehicle model including bump stop and shock absorber nonlinearities is developed. Subsequently, a new robust fuzzy logic control strategy is developed and applied to tracked vehicle. In the process of designing robust controller, a linearized model is used with uncertainties and disturbances. The errors between linearized model and actual nonlinear tracked vehicle model are compensated by fuzzy logic controller. In the end, control performances to isolate vibration from bump are evaluated through computer simulation under Matlab and ADAMS environments.","active suspension, adams simulation, fuzzy logical control, high mobility tracked vehicle, robust control, mathematical model, tracking system, shock absorbers, vehicle dynamics, uncertainty, indexing terms, linear model, vibration isolation, computer simulation, process design, fuzzy control, fuzzy logic, linear systems"
"Rorschach records of 109 unselected veterans who had received therapy were used to predict the results of the treatment. Psychologists experienced in the method did no better than chance in predicting outcomes. Combinations of various variables also failed to discriminate between the criterion groups; 99 Rorschach scores also failed to discriminate. Extensor M's, when appearing alone in a record, were associated with improvement in therapy. Rules for prediction obtained empirically and cross validated showed promise.

"Transposition of the great arteries (TGA), also referred to as complete transposition, is a congenital cardiac malformation characterised by atrioventricular concordance and ventriculoarterial (VA) discordance. The incidence is estimated at 1 in 3,500-5,000 live births, with a male-to-female ratio 1.5 to 3.2:1. In 50% of cases, the VA discordance is an isolated finding. In 10% of cases, TGA is associated with noncardiac malformations. The association with other cardiac malformations such as ventricular septal defect (VSD) and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is frequent and dictates timing and clinical presentation, which consists of cyanosis with or without congestive heart failure. The onset and severity depend on anatomical and functional variants that influence the degree of mixing between the two circulations. If no obstructive lesions are present and there is a large VSD, cyanosis may go undetected and only be perceived during episodes of crying or agitation. In these cases, signs of congestive heart failure prevail. The exact aetiology remains unknown. Some associated risk factors (gestational diabetes mellitus, maternal exposure to rodenticides and herbicides, maternal use of antiepileptic drugs) have been postulated. Mutations in growth differentiation factor-1 gene, the thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein-2 gene and the gene encoding the cryptic protein have been shown implicated in discordant VA connections, but they explain only a small minority of TGA cases.The diagnosis is confirmed by echocardiography, which also provides the morphological details required for future surgical management. Prenatal diagnosis by foetal echocardiography is possible and desirable, as it may improve the early neonatal management and reduce morbidity and mortality. Differential diagnosis includes other causes of central neonatal cyanosis. Palliative treatment with prostaglandin E1 and balloon atrial septostomy are usually required soon after birth. Surgical correction is performed at a later stage. Usually, the Jatene arterial switch operation is the procedure of choice. Whenever this operation is not feasible, adequate alternative surgical approach should be implemented. With the advent of newer and improved surgical techniques and post operative intensive care, the long-term survival is approximately 90% at 15 years of age. However, the exercise performance, cognitive function and quality of life may be impaired.","thyroid hormone receptor, medicinal chemistry, quality of life, cognitive function, risk factors"

"Transcription factor GATA-1 and its cofactor FOG-1 coordinate erythroid cell maturation by activating erythroid-specific genes and repressing genes associated with the undifferentiated state. Here we show that FOG-1 binds to the NuRD corepressor complex in vitro and in vivo. The interaction is mediated by a small conserved domain at the extreme N-terminus of FOG-1 that is necessary and sufficient for NuRD binding. This domain defines a novel repression module found in diverse transcriptional repressors. NuRD is present at GATA-1/FOG-1-repressed genes in erythroid cells in vivo. Point mutations near the N-terminus of FOG-1 that abrogate NuRD binding block gene repression by FOG-1. Finally, the ability of GATA-1 to repress transcription was impaired in erythroid cells expressing mutant forms of FOG-1 that are defective for NuRD binding. Together, these studies show that FOG-1 and likely other FOG-like proteins are corepressors that link GATA factors to histone deacetylation and nucleosome remodeling.","gene regulation, transcription, protein receptor, chromatin, dna binding protein"
"The validity of the Concealed Information Test (CIT) to detect recognition of critical details has been demonstrated in hundreds of laboratory studies. These studies, however, lack the factor of deliberate intent to deceive. This disparity between research and practice may affect the generalizability of laboratory based CIT findings. In the current study, 65 out of 174 participants cheated on their own initiative in a trivia quiz. These self-initiated cheaters were compared to 68 participants who were explicitly requested to cheat. Skin conductance, heart rate, and respiration were found to detect concealed information related to cheating. No significant differences emerged between self-initiated and instructed cheaters, supported by Bayesian statistics showing substantial evidence for the null hypothesis. The data demonstrate that the validity of the CIT is not restricted to instructed deception. This finding is encouraging from an ecological validity perspective and may pave the way for further field implementation of memory detection.","Cheating, Concealed Information Test (CIT), Deception External Validity, Dishonesty, Memory detection"
This paper investigates the buckling of multistory frames braced by vertical beams. The sectional properties of the frames and the bracing beam are assumed to vary linearly along the height; the axial forces in the columns and the bracing beam are also assumed to linearly change along the height. A relationship between the buckling load and the bracing rigidity is established. The threshold rigidity for the vertical bracing beam which is just enough to make the frames buckle in a non-sway mode is obtained. The result may be used as a rational basis for classifying sway frames and non-sway frames after taking the influence of initial imperfections and lateral loads into account.,"critical load, brace, threshold stiffness, buckling, frame"
"In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of a concurrency control manager for the Tachyon, a main-memory DBMS. Since a main-memory DBMS, unlike a disk-resident DBMS, performs all of data updates or data retrievals by accessing main-memory only, the portion of the cost for the concurrency control manager in the total cost for a data update or a data retrieval is fairly high. Thus, the development of an efficient concurrency control manager highly accelerates the performance of the entire main-memory DBMS. Our concurrency control manager employs the two-phase locking protocol, and has the following characteristics. First, it adapts the partition, an allocation unit of main-memory, as a locking granule, and thus, effectively adjusts the trade-off between the system concurrency and locking cost through the analysis of applications. Second, it enjoys low locking costs by maintaining the lock information directly in the partition itself. Third, it provides the latch as a mechanism for physical consistency of system data. Our latch supports both of the shared and exclusive modes, and maximizes the CPU utilization by combining the Bakery algorithm and the Unix semaphore facility. Fourth, for solving the deadlock problem, it periodically examines whether a system is in a deadlock state based on lock waiting information. In addition, we discuss various issues arising in development such as mutual exclusion of a transaction table, mutual exclusion of indexes and system catalogs, phantom problem handling, and real-time application supports.","Concurrency control, DBMSS, Latching, Locking, Main-memory DBMSs"
"The study was carried out to analyze national and international publications evaluating impact of social factors on population mortality. The analysis was made on the basis of publications accessible in prints and electronic format (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science) in Russian and English from 1990 to 2015. The results of generalized studies testify a valuable impact on standardized mortality coefficients of such factors as social support and social integration, higher level of education, higher social position, global peacefulness index, developed infrastructure. The negative impact is made by social stress, lower level of education, higher level of unemployment, social deprivation. It is established that social factors are ones the main factors effecting population mortality level. The effect of social factors is ambivalent and heterogeneous in time and by population groups. he quantitative evaluation of effect of every one of social factors is difficult.","global peacefulness index, gross domestic product, mortality, poverty, social deprivation, social economic condition of citizen, social factors, social stress, social support"
"Bisphosphonate inhibition of bone resorption was proposed to be due to osteoclast apoptosis. We tested this hypothesis for both the N-containing bisphosphonates alendronate and risedronate, which inhibit farnesyldiphosphate synthase and thus protein isoprenylation, and for clodronate and etidronate, which are metabolized to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analogs. We found, in dose-response studies, that alendronate and risedronate inhibit bone resorption (in pit assays) at doses tenfold lower than those reducing osteoclast number. At an N-bisphosphonate dose that inhibited resorption and induced apoptosis, the antiapoptotic caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, maintained osteoclast (Oc) number but did not prevent inhibition of resorption. Furthermore, when cells were treated with either alendronate alone or in combination with Z-VAD-FMK for 24 or 48 h, subsequent addition of geranylgeraniol, which restores geranylgeranylation, returned bone resorption to control levels. On the other hand, Z-VAD-FMK did block etidronate and clodronate inhibition of resorption. Moreover, in cells treated with etidronate, but not alendronate or risedronate, Z-VAD-FMK also prevented actin disruption, an early sign of osteoclast inhibition by bisphosphonates. These observations indicate that, whereas induction of apoptosis plays a major role in etidronate and clodronate inhibition of resorption, alendronate and risedronate suppression of bone resorption is independent of their effects on apoptosis.","risedronate, apoptosis, alendronate, osteoclast, bone resorption, nitrogen bisphosphonate, nitrogen, dose response"
"One of the undesired effects of software evolution is the proliferation of unused components, which are not used by any application. As a consequence, the size of binaries and libraries tends to grow and system maintainability tends to decrease. At the same time, a major trend of today's software market is the porting of applications on hand-held devices or, in general, on devices which have a limited amount of available resources. Refactoring and, in particular, the miniaturization of libraries and applications are therefore necessary. We propose a Software Renovation Framework (SRF) and a toolkit covering several aspects of software renovation, such as removing unused objects and code clones, and refactoring existing libraries into smaller more cohesive ones. Refactoring has been implemented in the SRF using a hybrid approach based on hierarchical clustering, on genetic algorithms and hill climbing, also taking into account the developers' feedback. The SRF aims to monitor software system quality in terms of the identified affecting factors, and to perform renovation activities when necessary. Most of the framework activities are language-independent, do not require any kind of source code parsing, and rely on object module analysis. The SRF has been applied to GRASS, which is a large open source Geographical Information System of about one million LOCs in size. It has significantly improved the software organization, has reduced by about 50% the average number of objects linked by each application, and has consequently also reduced the applications' memory requirements.","large open source, hill climbing, software organization, system maintainability, software renovation, source code parsing, software evolution, refactoring, genetic algorithms, renovation activity, language-independent software renovation framework, code clone, clustering, software market, software system quality, hierarchical clustering, genetic algorithm, geographic information system, source code, software systems"
"To estimate the direct (medical and prescription drug) and indirect (work loss) costs of children treated for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and their family members.The data source was an administrative database from a national, Fortune 100 manufacturer that included all medical, pharmaceutical, and disability claims for beneficiaries (n > 100,000). The analysis involved four samples. The ADHD patient sample included individuals age 18 or younger with at least one ADHD claim during the study period (1996-1998). Resource utilization of ADHD patients was contrasted with a matched control sample of patients who did not have claims for ADHD. The ADHD and non-ADHD family samples included non-ADHD family members of ADHD patients and their matched controls.The annual average expenditure (direct cost) per ADHD patient was $1,574, compared to $541 among matched controls. The annual average payment (direct plus indirect cost) per family member was $2,728 for non-ADHD family members of ADHD patients versus $1,440 for family members of matched controls. Both patient and family cost differences were significant at the 95% confidence level.ADHD imposes a significant financial burden regarding the cost of medical care and work loss for patients and family members.","indirect costs, direct costs, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, family burden, indirect cost"
"Wnt5a is overexpressed during the progression of human non-small cell lung cancer. However, the roles of Wnt5a during smoking-related lung carcinogenesis have not been clearly elucidated. We investigated the associations between Wnt5a and the early development of cigarette smoke related lung cancer using human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells (NHBE, BEAS-2B, 1799, 1198 and 1170I) at different malignant stages established by exposure to cigarette smoke condensate (CSC). Abnormal up-regulation of Wnt5a mRNA and proteins was detected in CSC-exposed transformed 1198 and tumorigenic 1170I cells as compared with other non-CSC exposed HBE cells. Tumor tissues obtained from smokers showed higher Wnt5a expressions than matched normal tissues. In non-CSC exposed 1799 cells, treatment of recombinant Wnt5a caused the activations of PKC and Akt, and the blockage of Wnt5a and PKC significantly decreased the viabilities of CSC-transformed 1198 cells expressing high levels of Wnt5a. This reduced cell survival rate was associated with increased apoptosis via the down-regulation of Bcl2 and the induction of cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase. Moreover, CSC-treated 1799 cells showed induction of Wnt5a expression and enhanced colony-forming capacity. The CSC-induced colony forming efficiency was suppressed by the co-incubation with a PKC inhibitor. In conclusion, these results suggest that cigarette smoke induces Wnt5a-coupled PKC activity during lung carcinogenesis, which causes Akt activity and anti-apoptosis in lung cancer. Therefore, current study provides novel clues for the crucial role of Wnt5a in the smoking-related lung carcinogenesis.","engineering, physics, enzyme activation, apoptosis, biology, medicine, protein kinase c, chemistry, signal transduction, smoke"

"Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) is implicated in the development of the vertebrate neural circuitry, and increases neurite growth in vitro and in vivo. We examined the relationship of IGF-II expression to the in vitro differentiation induced by retinoic acid (RA). We find that RA stimulates an increase in IGF-II messenger RNA (mRNA) in the SK-N-SH (SH) neuroblastoma cell line. An increase of IGF-II mRNA is detected within 12 h of treatment and precedes morphological differentiation. A RA dose response test indicates that an increase in IGF-II mRNA occurs within 2 days in SH cells treated with doses of RA from 1 x 10(-8) to 1 x 10(-5) M. We suggest that IGF-II expression may be regulated either directly or indirectly by RA in vitro and may lead to neuroblastoma differentiation.","retinoic acid, differentiation, insulin-like growth factor ii, neuroblastoma, cell line"
"Heterogeneous systems mix different technical domains such as signal processing, analog and digital electronics, software, telecommunication protocols, etc. Heterogeneous systems are composed of subsystems that are designed using different models of computation (MoC). These MoCs are the laws that govern the interactions of the components of a subsystem. The design of heterogeneous systems includes the design of each part of the system according to its specific MoC, and the connection of the parts in order to build the model representing the system. Indeed, this model allows the MoCs that govern different parts of system to coexist and interact. To be able to use a component which is specified according to a given MoC, under other, different MoCs, we can use either a hierarchical or a non-hierarchical approach, or we can build domain-specific components (DSC). However, these solutions present several disadvantages. This paper presents a new model of component, called domain-polymorph component (DPC). Such a component is atomic and is able to execute its core behavior, specified under a given MoC, under different host MoCs. This approach is not a competitor to the approaches above but is complementary.","heterogeneous design, different part, heterogeneous systems mix, domain-specific component, different model, different technical domain, heterogeneous embedded systems, components, different mocs, heterogeneous system design, actors, different host mocs, heterogeneous system, domain-polymorph component, software engineering, specific moc, model of computation, signal processing, embedded system, polymorphism"
"Proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, are involved in sleep regulation. IL-4 is an antiinflammatory cytokine that inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production. The hypothesis that IL-4 should attenuate sleep was studied by determining the effects of IL-4 on rabbit spontaneous sleep. Thirty-six rabbits were used. Four doses of IL-4 (0.25, 2.5, 25, and 250 ng) were injected intracerebroventricularly during the rest (light) period. One dose of IL-4 (25 ng) was injected during the active (dark) cycle. Appropriate time-matched control injections of saline were done in the same rabbits on different days. The three highest doses of IL-4 significantly inhibited spontaneous non-rapid eye movement sleep if IL-4 was given during the light cycle. The highest dose of IL-4 (250 ng) also significantly decreased rapid eye movement sleep. On the other hand, IL-4 administered at dark onset had no effect on sleep. The sleep inhibitory properties of IL-4 provide additional evidence for the hypothesis that a brain cytokine network is involved in the regulation of physiological sleep.","brain temperature, cytokines, electroencephalogram, non-rapid eye movement sleep, rapid eye movement sleep"
"Cancer is the leading cause of death and the second most common cause of hospitalisation in Singapore. Significant functional gains are achievable with cancer rehabilitation yet there are no formal cancer rehabilitation programmes in Singapore. This study aims to describe the demographics, clinical characteristics, complications and functional outcomes of cancer patients undergoing comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation at our unit and compare these with non-cancer patients. It also seeks to compare these data within sub-groups of the cancer cohort.This is a prospective cohort study. The Department of Rehabilitation Medicine database was reviewed for the period between 1 July 2002 and 31 December 2006. One thousand seven hundred and fifty patients had complete records, of which 58 are cancer patients. The primary outcome measures were the discharge total Functional Independence Measure (FIM), FIM gain and FIM efficiency. Other outcome measures included the length of rehabilitation stay, discharge destination, complication rates, rate of transfer back to the referring unit, the length of survival of the cancer patients upon discharge and the durability of the functional improvement made.The mean age of the cancer patients was 57.4 +/- 16.1 years and 62% were male. The mean admission total FIM was 70.9 +/- 18.0 and the total discharge FIM was 86.2 +/- 18.3. The average FIM gain was 15.3 +/- 11.6 and the mean efficiency was 0.867 +/- 0.806. This improvement is highly significant, and there is no statistical difference in FIM gain or efficiency between the cancer and non-cancer cohort, or between the cancer subgroups. The length of stay was similar in cancer and non-cancer cohorts but cancer patients with spinal metastasis and those who underwent concomitant radiotherapy stayed longer. There were good rates of discharge home, transfer back, survivorship and durability in functional gains.Cancer patients benefit as much as non-cancer patients in undergoing a rehabilitation programme. More patients should be admitted to such programmes and these programmes should be better structured and refined.","complications, durability, efficiency, radiotherapy, cohort study, cause of death"
"Posttraumatic growth has garnered increasing interest as a potential positive consequence of traumatic events and illnesses. However, scientific investigations have yet to demonstrate the validity of self-reports of posttraumatic growth. The most common measure used to assess this construct is the Post Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI); however, the extent to which the PTGI (as well as other self-report measures of perceived posttraumatic growth; PPTG) assess actual positive change remains unknown. The present study aimed to examine the validity of PPTG measures. We assessed 83 adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors at two time points, one year apart. We measured the stability of PTGI from T1 to T2, correlated three measures of PPTG that used different methods (only positive, positive or negative, positive and negative change) with wellbeing measures, and compared PTGI scores with changes in psychosocial resources. PTGI scores were stable over time. More nuanced measures of PPTG appeared to capture more perceived change, although no measure of PPTG was favorably related to wellbeing. Finally, PTGI did not correlate with change in psychosocial resources, with the exception of spirituality.

Then the mass defect filtering (MDF) approach, which was developed based on the previously published articles, was utilized to rapidly screen the astragalosides from the obtained LC-TOF-MS data. Each screened astragaloside was confirmed by the presence of no less than 2 quasi-molecular ions. All the screened astragalosides were then tentatively assigned according to the parent ion and daughter ion information. Finally, a total of 62 astragalosides were screened and characterized from the HI samples, including 15 new detected ones. The identification results indicated that acetylation, hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, methoxylation and hydration might be the major conversion reactions involved in the formation of the astragalosides. The LC-TOF-MS-based MDF approach was proved to be a feasible and efficient tool to screen the chemical constituents in complex matrices such as herbal medicines.","Huangqi injections, LC-TOF-MS, astragalosides, conversion reactions, mass defect filter"
"Combining resources to develop complex solutions (e.g., products or services) involves a varied set of business actors. Research tends to assume that actors are more or less autonomous in combining the resources they use. Presenting findings from a study of the construction of the first two pre-discharge homes for patients with cognitive and motor disabilities, we show that the autonomy of the single actor in combining resources is limited and that resource combinations are collectively enacted. Consequently, the features of the emergent resource combinations depend on the set of actors involved. We also argue that each actor takes part in resource combination both as provider and as user of resources; the two roles imply different perspectives that lead to different focal points which, in turn, impact how resources interface. The two roles orient the conduct of parties and, as confronted in business relationships, they shape the development of business relationship and resource combinations.","domotics, interaction, actors, business networks, solution, resource combining, business relationship"
"To provide an overview of the genetic epidemiology of substance use and misuse in adolescents.A selective review of genetically informative research strategies, their limitations, and key findings examining issues related to the heritability of substance use and substance use disorders in children and adolescents is presented.Adoption, twin, and extended-family designs have established there is a strong heritable component to liability to nicotine, alcohol, and illicit drug dependence in adults. However, shared environmental influences are relatively stronger in youth samples and at earlier stages of substance involvement (e.g., use). There is considerable overlap in the genetic influences associated with the abuse/dependence across drug classes, and shared genetic influences contribute to the commonly observed associations between substance-use disorders and externalizing and, to a lesser extent, internalizing psychopathology. Rapid technologic advances have made the identification of specific gene variants that influence risks for substance-use disorders feasible, and linkage and association (including genomewide association studies) have identified promising candidate genes implicated in the development of substance-use disorders.Studies using genetically informative research designs, including those that examine aggregate genetic factors and those examining specific gene variants, individually and in interaction with environmental influences, offer promising avenues not only for delineating genetic effects on substance-use disorders but also for understanding the unfolding of risk across development and the interaction between environmental and genetic factors in the etiology of these disorders.","genetics, twin, substance-use disorders, gene-by-environment interaction, adolescence, interaction, epidemiology, heredity, etiology, social environment, phenotype, drug abuse, gene by environment interaction, research methodology, substance use disorder, psychopathology, adoption"
"Background/Purpose : Pathological vascular architecture is a feature of neoangiogenic processes such as diseases of the retina and tumor growth. The authors hypothesized that experimental human Wilm's tumors would display a vascular architecture similar to retinal diseases that are driven by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Methods : Human Wilms' tumors were established in the right kidneys of nude mice. After 4.5 weeks of tumor growth, fluorescein angiograms were performed before death. Representative sections of tumors and contralateral, control kidneys were evaluated by fluorescent microscopy. Results : Fluorescein angiograms demonstrated a characteristic pathological architecture. Vascular tortuosity, capillary tufting, and hemorrhage were noted. These features were not present in normal kidneys. Conclusions : Vascular architecture of Wilms' tumor displays the specific features previously described in diseases of the retina, which have been shown to be driven by VEGF, suggesting that neoangiogenesis in this model is also VEGF driven.","vascular endothelial growth factor, wilms' tumor, angiogenesis, fluorescein, retina, fluorescence microscopy"
"The college years occur during the stage of life when many people develop permanent smoking habits, and approximately one-third go on to become addicted smokers. The 18-24 year demographic that makes up the majority of undergraduate attendees represents the earliest years that the tobacco industry now can legally attempt to lure new customers into smoking. This research investigated the ways in which university tobacco control policies are developed, introduced to students, faculty and staff and how they are implemented and enforced. Findings show that tobacco control initiatives at Canadian undergraduate universities face a wide range of challenges including a lack of dedicated and consistent tobacco control personnel, ownership issues, funding, enforcement and monitoring dilemmas. Participants also reported that the layout and geographic location of the campus can result in difficulties in implementation. Consequently, it appears that there may be a growing, although inadvertent, tolerance for smoking on Canadian campuses.","health promotion, geographic location, health policy, young adults, public health"
"In this paper, a concurrency control scheme to increase concurrency among methods in object-oriented database systems (OODBs) is presented. The author is concerned with all types of access to an object: instance access and class definition access. For instance access, the proposed work has the following characteristics. First, construction of commutativity relation among methods can be automated. Second, it provides more concurrency by taking attributes as locking granularity. Third, deadlocks due to lock escalation can be reduced. Finally, concurrency is increased further with the use of run-time information. For class definition access, the proposed work allows class definition access methods to run concurrently by taking fine granularity. The proposed work also allows more parallelism between class definition access methods and instance access methods. For the performance evaluation of the proposed scheme, a simulation model is constructed. Using this model, the proposed technique is then compared with the two existing techniques. The performance studies show that the proposed scheme is superior to existing works.","object-oriented database, multi-granularity locking-based concurrency control, concurrency control, transaction processing, object-oriented database system, simulation model, access method"
"A rapid and simple method of detection immunoglobulin was developed by using quantum dots labeled immunoassay. The Goat anti-Mouse IgG labelled quantum dots are mixed with Mouse IgG. After the immunoreaction, the quantum dots are aggregated to form a network, which can quench the fluorescence of themselves in the reaction system. The more Mouse IgG is, the bigger the network is, and the fluorescence intensity of quantum dots decreases continually. The concentration of Mouse IgG can be detected by the measurement of relative fluorescence intensity.","Fluorescence quenching, Immunoassay, Mouse IgG, Quantum dots"
"Object-Oriented (OO) design patterns are an emergent technology: they are reusable micro-architectures, high-level building blocks. A system which has been designed using well-known, documented and accepted design patterns is also likely to exhibit good properties such as modularity, separation of concerns and maintainability. While for forward engineering the benefits of using design patterns are clear, using reverse engineering technologies to discover instances of patterns in a software artifact (e.g., design or code) may help in several key areas, among which are program understanding, design-to-code traceability and quality assessment. This paper describes a conservative approach and experimental results, based on a multi-stage reduction strategy using OO software metrics and structural properties to extract structural design patterns from OO design or C++ code. To assess the effectiveness of the pattern recovery approach, a process and a portable tool suite written in Java, remotely accessible by means of any WEB browser, has been developed. The developed system and experimental results on 8 industrial software (design and code) and 200,000 lines of public domain C++ code are presented.","software metrics, oo design pattern recovery, object-oriented design patterns recovery, traceability, oo redocumentation, object oriented design, software metric, object oriented, reverse engineering, public domain, separation of concern, emerging technology, design pattern"
"According to the direct accurate corresponding relation between the geometry size parameter and its water content of the plant leaf, a new method of the measurement of plant vane thickness is put forward by using resistance strain sensor and differential inductance sensor. In the transition circuit of differential inductance, an innovative method of adopting the integrated circuit of single chip as the transition circuit is proposed. Proved by the experiment, this instrument has many advantages such as good linear degree, high measuring precision and strong ability to resist environment interference etc. It is a kind of new-type closed loop system of water-saving irrigation.","Measurement of plant vane thickness, New-type closed loop system of water-saving irrigation, Sensor, Transition circuit of differential inductance"
The present study explores three uncertainty reduction mechanisms that arise in the context of business alliance formation to assess whether these same mechanisms also operate in the development of alliances between non-profits and businesses. Secondary data from field-based case studies of Latin American cross-sector alliances are the focus of this analysis. The findings show that the same mechanisms operate to reduce uncertainty in cross-sector alliance formation and that alliance experience appears to determine the presence of some mechanisms.,"non-profit, latin america, cross-sector, alliance, latin american, profitability"
"Most companies in the world are family-owned, and a majority of them operate in countries where the legal protection of minority shareholders is weak at best. In spite of previous arguments to the contrary, research shows that agency problems among owners actually increase in family-ownership situations, so family control by itself may not be an efficient substitute for the legal protection of minority investors. In this article we analyze successful strategies used by non-US business groups and firms to increase the satisfaction of their minority shareholders and to limit the incentives of the controlling shareholders to abuse them, and predict the outcomes of that protection. From these experiences we are able to suggest conditions needed to link family control and minority shareholder protection.","corporate governance, shareholders, business group, agency problem"
"Framework-based development is currently regarded as one of the most promising software development approaches when it comes to improvements in lead time, productivity and quality. However, many frameworks and projects based on frameworks still report failures, which indicate that there are problems related to both frameworks technology and frameworks usage. The objective of our research was to examine the major drivers that have an impact on a framework's acceptance and a framework's success. We used the technology acceptance model (TAM) and Seddon's information systems success model as our underlying theory. Data collected from an online survey of 389 active framework users was used to test hypothesized models. Data analysis was performed via structural equation modeling. Our findings support the post-adoption version of TAM and the relationship between continuous use and the successful use of systems, where more use also means more net benefits. We found that the successful use of frameworks is mainly dependent on two factors: continuous framework usage intention and the perceived usefulness of the framework. Several practical and theoretical implications can be foreseen including advances in framework development guidelines and insight into the relationship between the acceptance and success of frameworks.","structural equation models, survey, promising software development, continuous framework usage intention, information systems success model, successful use, frameworks usage, technology acceptance model, empirical examination, post adoption behavior, frameworks technology, continuous use, information system success, active framework user, application frameworks, framework development guideline, framework-based development, application frameworks success, data analysis, data collection, structural equation model, software development"

"Left atrium (LA) plays an important role in left ventricular filling. It is well known that right ventricular apical pacing has unfavorable effects on ventricular systolic and diastolic performance. The aim of this study is to evaluate the LA mechanical functions with 2D echocardiography in patients with a permanent pacemaker after short time ventricular pacing.Echocardiographic examination was performed in 38 patients (mean age 63.0+/- 10.9, 18 female) with dual chamber pacemakers or defibrillators (< 20% ventricular pacing within previous 6 months, all of them on sinus rhythm) before and after 4 hours > 90% ventricular pacing at 70 beats per minute in DDD mode with an optimal AV interval. Left atrial volumes (LAV) including at the time of mitral valve opening (Vmax), at closure (Vmin), and at the onset of atrial systole (Volp) were measured. The passive emptying, conduit, active emptying and total emptying volume, stroke volumes were also calculated.No significant differences were noted at baseline and after pacing for absolute Vmax, Volp, passive emptying, conduit, active emptying, total emptying volumes as well as the volumes indexed to body surface area (p >0.05).Short - time RV pacing seems to have no acute effects on left atrial mechanical functions.","pacemaker, echocardiography, left atrial function, left atrial volume"
"A current controversy in the area of implicit statistical learning (ISL) is whether this process consists of a single, central mechanism or multiple modality-specific ones. To provide insight into this question, the current study involved three ISL experiments to explore whether multimodal input sources are processed separately in each modality or are integrated together across modalities. In Experiment 1, visual and auditory ISL were measured under unimodal conditions, with the results providing a baseline level of learning for subsequent experiments. Visual and auditory sequences were presented separately, and the underlying grammar used for both modalities was the same. In Experiment 2, visual and auditory sequences were presented simultaneously with each modality using the same artificial grammar to investigate whether redundant multisensory information would result in a facilitative effect (i.e., increased learning) compared to the baseline. In Experiment 3, visual and auditory sequences were again presented simultaneously but this time with each modality employing different artificial grammars to investigate whether an interference effect (i.e., decreased learning) would be observed compared to the baseline. Results showed that there was neither a facilitative learning effect in Experiment 2 nor an interference effect in Experiment 3. These findings suggest that participants were able to track simultaneously and independently two sets of sequential regularities under dual-modality conditions. These findings are consistent with the theories that posit the existence of multiple, modality-specific ISL mechanisms rather than a single central one.","cross-modal learning, dual-modality, implicit statistical learning, modality-specific, multimodal input"

"Reports of discrete components of parent behavior were collected on the 26 scales of the Children's Reports of Parental Behavior Inventory. 3 replicated factors--Acceptance vs. Rejection, Psychological Autonomy vs. Psychological Control, and Firm Control vs. Lax Control--were identified from 4 correlation matrices of reports of maternal and of paternal behavior by children and by adults. Conceptual planes generated by pairs of factors differentiated Acceptance of Individuation from Loving Involvement and Hostile Involvement from Hostile Detachment. This configurational analysis facilitated the comparison of these results with other analyses of the structure of parent behavior. A spherical conceptual model for parent behavior is proposed.

"This letter studies a three-hop channel constructed by collaborative relaying terminals at both the transmitter and receiver ends. Our objective is to optimize the complex amplify-and-forward (AF) weights of the relaying terminals if the channel state information (CSI) is exploited. A near-optimal numerical solution for the collaborative-relay beamforming (CRBF) weights is first found from solving an unconstrained multi-variant minimization problem. Using the concept of subspace averaging, a near-optimal closed-form CRBF solution is then proposed.","Relays, Signal to noise ratio, Array signal processing, Resource management, Optimization, MIMO"
"Reduced Beam Section (RBS) moment connections are newly developed connections for Special Moment Resisting Frames (SMRF). This study focuses on Reduced Beam Section with Bolted web connections (RBS-B). Several experiments have demonstrated that some RBS-B connection specimens failed prior to reaching the plastic moment capacity of the reduced beam sections: this may be attributed to insufficient moment strength in the RBS-B connections. This study proposes a new procedure for accurately computing the moment strength for ensuring that a plastic hinge forms in the reduced-section region of the beam, as intended by design.","plastic hinge, reduced beam section connections, moment strength, connections"
"Nonlinear resistivity inversion requires efficient artificial neural network (ANN) model for better inversion results. An evolutionary BP neural network (BPNN) approach based on differential evolution (DE) algorithm was presented, which was able to improve global search ability for resistivity tomography 2-D nonlinear inversion. In the proposed method, Tent equation was applied to obtain automatic parameter settings in DE and the restricted parameter F crit was used to enhance the ability of converging to global optimum. An implementation of proposed DE-BPNN was given, the network had one hidden layer with 52 nodes and it was trained on 36 datasets and tested on another 4 synthetic datasets. Two abnormity models were used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, the results show that the proposed DE-BP algorithm has better performance than BP, conventional DE-BP and other chaotic DE-BP methods in stability and accuracy, and higher imaging quality than least square inversion.","electrical resistivity tomography, nonlinear inversion, differential evolution, back propagation network, Tent map"
"When measles vaccines were widely introduced in the 1970s, there were concerns that they might cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE): a very rare, late-onset, neurological complication of natural measles infection. Therefore, SSPE registries and routine measles immunization were established in many countries concurrently. We conducted a comprehensive review of the impact of measles immunization on the epidemiology of SSPE and examined epidemiological evidence on whether there was any vaccine-associated risk.Published epidemiological data on SSPE, national SSPE incidence, measles incidence and vaccine coverage, reports of SSPE in pregnancy or shortly post partum were reviewed. Potential adverse relationships between measles vaccines and SSPE were examined using available data.Epidemiological data showed that successful measles immunization programmes protect against SSPE and, consistent with virological data, that measles vaccine virus does not cause SSPE. Measles vaccine does not: accelerate the course of SSPE; trigger SSPE or cause SSPE in those with an established benign persistent wild measles infection. Evidence points to wild virus causing SSPE in cases which have been immunized and have had no known natural measles infection. Perinatal measles infection may result in SSPE with a short onset latency and fulminant course. Such cases are very rare. SSPE during pregnancy appears to be fulminant. Infants born to mothers with SSPE have not been subsequently diagnosed with SSPE themselves.Successful measles vaccination programmes directly and indirectly protect the population against SSPE and have the potential to eliminate SSPE through the elimination of measles. Epidemiological and virological data suggest that measles vaccine does not cause SSPE.","measles, genotype, epidemiology, mmr vaccine, vaccination, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, measles vaccine, sspe"
"This study examined the effects of amniocyte-based engineered tendons on partial diaphragmatic replacement.Ovine mesenchymal amniocytes were labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP), expanded, and seeded into a collagen hydrogel. Composite grafts (20 to 25 cm2) based on acellular dermis (group I), or acellular small intestinal submucosa (group II) received either a cell-seeded or an acellular hydrogel within their layers. Newborn lambs (n = 20) underwent partial diaphragmatic replacement with either an acellular or a cellular autologous construct from either group. At 3 to 12 months' postoperatively, implants were subjected to multiple analyses.Diaphragmatic hernia recurrence was significantly higher in animals with acellular grafts (5 of 5) then in animals with cellular ones (1 of 4) in group I (P <.05) but not in group II (3 of 6 and 4 of 5, respectively). Cellular grafts had higher modular (5.27 +/- 1.98 v. 1.27 +/- 0.38 MPa) and ultimate (1.94 +/- 0.70 v. 0.29 +/- 0.05 MPa) tensile strength than acellular implants in group I (P <.05), but not in group II. Quantitative analyses showed no differences in extracellular matrix components between cellular and acellular implants in either group. All cellular implants showed GFP-positive cells.Diaphragmatic repair with an autologous tendon engineered from mesenchymal amniocytes leads to improved mechanical and functional outcomes when compared with an equivalent acellular bioprosthetic repair, depending on scaffold composition. The amniotic fluid may be a preferred cell source for engineered diaphragmatic reconstruction.","fetus, tissue engineering, prenatal, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, neonate, transplantation, birth defects, diaphragm, amniotic fluid, congenital anomalies"

"The buckling of thin-walled steel plates which are juxtaposed with a rigid medium must be treated as a contact problem, since the local buckles may only form away from the rigid medium in a unilateral mode. One particular example is the bolting of plates to the sides of reinforced concrete beams in order to stiffen and strengthen the original concrete beam. Plates which experience first yield before local buckling are referred to as semi-compact, and this paper uses an energy method developed elsewhere by the authors to study the unilateral local buckling of restrained plates, so that limiting depth to thickness ratios may be obtained that delineate the semi-compact section classification when the plate is subjected to a combination of bending, compressive and shearing actions. The application to retrofitting concrete beams is discussed.","unilateral buckling, rayleigh-ritz method, contact problem, yielding, section classification, elasticity"
"Features are meaningful abstractions of geometry that engineers use to reason about components, products, and processes. For design activity, features are design primitives, serve as the basis for product representations, and can incorporate information relevant to life-cycle activities such as manufacturing. Research on feature-based design has matured to the point that results are being incorporated into commercial CAD systems. The intent of this paper is to look forward. Hence, this paper does not play the role of a standard survey, which necessarily only reviews the past. Nevertheless, an appropriate historical context is provided as a basis for these particular futuristic projections. Applications of feature-based design and technologies of feature representations are reviewed, then open research issues are identified and put in the context of past and current work. Features are prominent as catalysts for computer-based design tools, but the vision presented expands upon this basis, delving beyond features. For that future design environment, four hypotheses are proposed as research challenges: two on the existence of fundamental subfeature elements and relationships for features, one that presents a new definition of design features, and one that argues for the successful development of concurrent engineering languages. Evidence for these hypotheses is provided from recent research results and from speculation about the future of feature-based design.",". computer-aided design, feature-based design, features, feature representation, computer aided design, concurrent engineering, life cycle"
"Stem cell-based approaches hold much promise as potential novel treatments to restore function after stroke. Studies in animal models have shown that stem cell transplantation can improve function by replacing neurons or by trophic actions, modulation of inflammation, promotion of angiogenesis, remyelination and axonal plasticity, and neuroprotection. Endogenous neural stem cells are also potential therapeutic targets because they produce new neurons after stroke. Clinical trials are ongoing but there is currently no proven stem cell-based therapy for stroke. Preclinical studies and clinical research will be needed to optimize the therapeutic benefit and minimize the risks of stem cells in stroke.","neurogenesis, neuroregeneration, neural stem cell, stem cells"
"An appropriate supply of member ductility is an important ingredient for successful earthquake resistant design since it enables the primary objective of a well controlled dissipative collapse mode to be realised, without excessive strength requirements being imposed on non-dissipative components. As with other performance criteria, uncertainties influence the actual ductility supply, with material variability being a key contributor. This paper examines the effect of this variability on cantilever tip deflection ductility, based on an interactive local buckling model developed for steel members subjected to large inelastic excursions. Probabilistic models for yield stress and strain hardening variability are introduced in a FORM reliability analysis, and their influence studied for a wide range of steel beam and column members. The results quantify material variability on member response, and are readily presented for design use through the definition of generalised parameters involving cross-section properties and material uncertainty coefficients.","seismic design, reliability, ductility, steel sections, yield stress, cross section, reliability analysis, strain hardening, probabilistic model"
"Data dependence analysis is essential in order to determine whether a loop can be vectorized or parallelized. It is used to investigate whether two memory references in a loop are in the same location. In this paper we present a new scheme of exact data dependence analysis for array subscript analysis in parallel programs, called interval reduction (IR) test. This method reduces the solution interval of each constraint variable in the dependence equation by repeated projection. Once the effective solution interval of any variable shrinks to empty, this linear diophantine equation has no integer solution and the memory accesses subject to this constraint are then independent. Otherwise, all the integer solutions can be found, and thus the dependence distance can be computed as well. Experimental results are also presented to show its effectiveness compared to the Power test and the Omega test.","array reference, array references, data dependence analysis, linear diophantine equation, parallelizing compilers, interval reduction test, diophantine equation, reference data, dependence analysis"
"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder that has no cure. HD primarily affects medium spiny striatal neurons (MSN). HD is caused by polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion (exp) in the amino-terminal region of a protein huntingtin (Htt). The connection between polyQ expansion in Htt(exp) and MSN neurodegeneration remains elusive. My laboratory discovered that mutant Htt(exp) protein specifically binds to the carboxy-terminal region of the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R1), an intracellular Ca2+ release channel. Moreover, we found that Htt(exp) association with InsP3R1 causes sensitization of InsP3R1 to activation by InsP3 in planar lipid bilayers and in primary MSN. Mutant Htt(exp) has also been shown to activate Ca2(+)-permeable NR2B-containing NMDA receptors. All these results suggested that deranged neuronal Ca2+ signaling may play an important role in pathogenesis of HD. In support of this idea, we demonstrated a connection between abnormal Ca2+ signaling and apoptosis of MSN cultured from YAC128 HD mouse model. These results indicate that InsP3R and other Ca2+ signaling proteins should be considered as potential therapeutic targets for treatment of HD.","huntingtin, polyglutamine expansion, calcium signaling, inositol, neurodegeneration"
"Analytic solutions are presented for steady interface flow in aquifers consisting of a confined and a semi-confined section. The total discharge is constant in the confined section and is directed towards the semi-confined section, which is bounded on top by a leaky layer that separates the aquifer from the sea. All solutions are based on the Dupuit approximation. The interface position is fully determined by two dimensionless parameters. The first parameter is the product of the uniform gradient towards the sea and the dimensionless leakage factor divided by the dimensionless density difference. The second dimensionless parameter is the length of the semi-confined section divided by the leakage factor. Four types of flow are distinguished. For cases I and II the interface does not reach the end of the semi-confined section, while it does for cases III and IV. For cases I and III the interface extends into the confined section, while for cases II and IV it remains entirely in the semi-confined section. Analytic solutions are presented for the position of the interface for all four cases. Diagrams are presented to determine the type of flow and the position of the interface toe based on the two dimensionless parameters. The pre-development position of the interface along the Georgia coast is computed as an illustration of the practical application of the presented formulas. Another practical application is the estimation of how far a numerical model of seawater intrusion should be extended into the sea for accurate simulations.","semi-confined, analytic solution, interface flow, seawater intrusion, submarine groundwater discharge"
"This paper describes a series of tests investigating methods to develop composite action in existing non-composite floor systems. Three types of 22-mm diameter post-installed shear connectors were tested under static and fatigue loading. Test results are compared with previous research results on 19-mm diameter, post-installed shear connectors as well as with conventional welded shear studs. Based on the test results, preliminary design equations are proposed for the static and fatigue strength of post-installed shear connectors. These post-installed shear connectors showed a significantly higher fatigue strength than conventional welded shear studs. The superior fatigue strength of these post-installed shear connectors enables the strengthening of existing bridge girders using significantly fewer shear connectors than possible with conventional welded shear studs.","Bridges, Anchor, Partially composite, Post-installed shear connector, Retrofit"

"Extensive literature conjectures that investor sentiment may be one of the important factors in explaining fund manager herding. To address this issue, this study investigates the role of investor sentiment in fund manager herding. The study employs the trinomial-distribution approach to measure manager herding, and uses the principal component analysis as the means of extracting the composite sentiment measure. The results indicate that investor sentiment plays a significant role in explaining subsequent mutual fund herding, especially on the sell-side. Specifically, the evidence is consistent with the funds sharing an aversion to stocks that have previously exhibited higher optimistic sentiment, supporting the sentiment countering hypothesis. The finding also reveals the existence of informational cascades in the case that fund managers herd as a result of analyzing the same sentiment-related indicators.","fund managers, investor sentiment, herding, principal component analysis, information cascades"

The present study presents results of a cross-validation of 49 different short forms. Unlike previous studies, the short forms are cross-validated on both a psychiatric and on a nonpsychiatric population. Results revealed that for both the psychiatric and the nonpsychiatric populations (a) the mean estimated and the mean Full Scale scores were significantly different in only 3 of 98 comparisons; (6) correlations between estimated and obtained Full Scale scores were in the high .80's or .90's; (c) in the great majority of instances subjects were placed within one classification of their intelligence classification as revealed by scores on the total test.

"The bovine patella model has been used extensively for studying important structure-function aspects of articular cartilage, including its degeneration. However, the degeneration seen in this model has, to our knowledge, never been adequately compared with human osteoarthritis (OA). In this study, bovine patellae displaying normal to severely degenerate states were compared with human tissue displaying intact cartilage to severe OA. Comparisons of normal and OA features were made with histological scoring, morphometric measurements, and qualitative observations. Differential interference contrast microscopy was used to image early OA changes in the articular cartilage matrix and to investigate whether this method provided comparable quality of visualisation of key structural features with standard histology. The intact bovine cartilage was found to be similar to healthy human cartilage and the degenerate bovine cartilage resembled the human OA tissues with regard to structural disruption, cellularity changes, and staining loss. The extent of degeneration in the bovine tissues matched the mild to moderate range of human OA tissues; however, no bovine samples exhibited late-stage OA. Additionally, in both bovine and human tissues, cartilage degeneration was accompanied by calcified cartilage thickening, tidemark duplication, and the advancement of the cement line by protrusions of bony spicules into the calcified cartilage. This comparison of degeneration in the bovine and human tissues suggests a common pathway for the progression of OA and thus the bovine patella is proposed to be an appropriate model for investigating the structural changes associated with early OA.","articular cartilage, bovine patella model, calcified cartilage, early osteoarthritis, grading systems, histology"

"The aim of this paper is to find some sufficient conditions for positivity of block matrices of positive operators. It is shown that for positive operators A, B, C and for every non-negative operator monotone function f on ( (0,infty )), the block matrix $$begin{aligned} left( begin{array}{cc} f(A) u0026{} f(C)  f(C) u0026{} f(B)  end{array} right) end{aligned}$$is positive if and only if (C le A!B).

"The hollow flange beam (HFB) is a unique cold-formed steel section developed in Australia for use as a flexural member. Research has identified that the HFB section's flexural capacity for intermediate span members is limited by lateral distortional buckling, which is characterized by simultaneous lateral deflection, twist, and web distortion. This buckling behaviour is mainly due to the unique geometry of the section, comprising two torsionally stiff triangular flanges connected by a slender web. This paper presents a finite element analytical model suitable for non-linear analysis of HFB flexural members. The model includes all significant effects that may influence the ultimate capacity of such members, including material inelasticity, local buckling, member instability, web distortion, residual stresses, and geometric imperfections. It was found to accurately predict both the elastic lateral distortional buckling moments and the ultimate capacities of HFB flexural members, and was therefore used in the development of design curves and suitable design procedures.","finite element analysis, design procedures, lateral distortional buckling, flexural capacity, hollow flange beams, bending strength, nonlinear equations, residual stresses, elasticity, buckling, finite element method, mathematical models"
"Most Content-Based Image Retrieval systems use image features such as textures, colors, and shapes. However, in the case of a leaf image, it is not appropriate to rely on color or texture features only as such features are very similar in most leaves. In this paper, we propose a new and effective leaf image retrieval scheme. In this scheme, we first analyze leaf venation which we use for leaf categorization. We then extract and utilize leaf shape features to find similar leaves from the already categorized group in a leaf database. The venation of a leaf corresponds to the blood vessels in organisms. Leaf venations are represented using points selected by a curvature scale scope corner detection method on the venation image. The selected points are then categorized by calculating the density of feature points using a non-parametric estimation density. We show this technique's effectiveness by performing several experiments on a prototype system.","leaf categorization, leaf venation, non-parametric estimation density, leaf database, leaf venations, venation feature, leaf image, leaf corresponds, efficient leaf image retrieval, effective leaf image retrieval, classification, cbir, venation, leaf image retrieval, parzen window, venation image, leaf shape feature, corner detection, image retrieval, image features"
"In this paper, a modular technique is described for the analysis of dual-reflector antennas using a reflectarray as a subreflector. An antenna configuration based on a sub-reflectarray and a parabolic main reflector provides better bandwidth than a single reflectarray, and has a number of advantages compared with a conventional dual-reflector antenna. Examples include the possibility of beam shaping by adjusting the phase on the sub-reflectarray, and potential capabilities to scan or reconfigure the beam. The modular technique implemented for the antenna analysis combines different methods for the analysis of each part of the antenna. First, the real field generated by the horn is considered as the incident field on each reflectarray element. Second, the reflectarray is analyzed with the same technique as for a single reflectarray, i.e., considering local periodicity and the real angle of incidence of the wave coming from the feed for each periodic cell. Third, the main reflector is analyzed using the Physical Optics (PO) technique, where the current on the reflector surface is calculated by summing the radiation from all the reflectarray elements. Finally, the field is calculated on a rectangular periodic mesh at a projected aperture, and then a time-efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm is used to compute the radiation pattern of the antenna. The last step significantly improves the computational efficiency. However, it introduces a phase error, which reduces the accuracy of the radiation patterns for radiation angles far away from the antenna's axis. The phase errors have been evaluated for two integration apertures. It has been demonstrated that accurate patterns are obtained in an angular range of plusmn6deg, which is sufficient for large reflectors. The method of analysis has been validated by comparing the results with simulations obtained from GRASP8. Finally, the theoretical beam-scanning performance of the antenna is analyzed.","antenna arrays, antenna radiation patterns, reflector antennas, shaped beam antennas, Physical Optics technique, antenna analysis, dual-reflector antennas, incident field, radiation pattern, rectangular periodic mesh, reflectarray, subreflector, time-efficient fast Fourier transform, Multireflector antennas, reflector antennas, reflectarray, shaped beam antennas, beam steering"
"An approach to control design for dead-time (DT) systems is proposed. The underlying idea is to treat the DT element not as a part of the generalized plant, but rather as a (causality) constraint imposed upon the controller (estimator). This enables one to use well-understood parametrizations of all delay free controllers in the DT design. In particular, DT controllers can be extracted from such delay-free parametrizations. In the paper, the extraction procedures are developed in both H/sup 2/ and H/sup /spl infin// settings. It is shown that the proposed approach yields simple solution procedures and new transparent and intuitively appealing structures for the resulting controllers and estimators.","Delay estimation, Control systems, Delay effects, Biological system modeling, Delay systems, Electrical equipment industry, Economic forecasting, Signal processing, Feedback, Control design"
"Staging of patients with lung cancer to determine operability is intended to efficiently limit futile thoracotomies without denying possibly curative surgery. Currently available staging tests are imperfect alone and in combination. Imaged suspected metastases often require tissue confirmation before surgery can be denied. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) may help identify inoperable patients by providing tissue proof of inoperability in a single staging test, with similar sensitivity for identifying inoperable patients as other staging tests. Therefore, we compared computed tomography, positron emission tomography (PET), and EUS with fine-needle aspiration under conscious sedation, each test interpreted blinded with respect to the other tests, for identifying inoperable patients in a consecutive cohort of 79 potentially operable patients with suspected or proven lung cancer. An economic analysis was also performed. Thirty-nine patients were found inoperable (a 40th patient's inoperability was missed by all preoperative staging tests). The sensitivity of computerized tomography was 43%. PET and EUS each had similar sensitivities (68 and 63%, respectively) and similar negative predictive values (64 and 68%, respectively), but EUS's superior specificity (100 vs. 72% for PET) and considerably lower expense means it may be preferred to PET early in staging to identify inoperable patients.","cost-effectiveness, mediastinum, staging, metastasis, computed tomography, cost effectiveness"
"The advantages of market orientation, entrepreneurship, and learning orientation to organizations have been evidently documented in Western economies. However, there has been little research into these practices and their impact on enhancing competitive advantages in emerging economies. This exploratory study, utilizing data from China's emerging economy, found that organizations with higher level of market orientation tend to be more learning-oriented, emphasize more on entrepreneurship, and be able to achieve higher level of organizational performance, than those with a lower level of market orientation.","entrepreneurship, market orientation, china, competitive advantage, organizational performance, emerging economies, exploratory study"
"Counterfeit trade is a multi-billion dollar industry affecting an ever-wider range of goods and markets. Despite the diversity of counterfeit products in terms of complexity, manufacturing techniques, investments in production facilities, potential dangers or value for the users, and degrees of conflict for the counterfeit producers with the local authorities, current academic literature still refers to counterfeit producers as one homogeneous group. Against this background, the present study investigates the existence of strategic groups among counterfeiters based on an empirical examination of counterfeited products using cluster analysis. The results indicate that brand owners are confronted with five different groups of counterfeiters: (1) disaggregators, (2) imitators, (3) fraudsters, (4) desperados, and (5) smugglers. The findings of this study contribute to a more differentiated understanding of each group's learning and growth strategies and help practitioners to better position their companies with respect to the counterfeit market.","counterfeit trade, brand protection, strategic groups, anti-counterfeiting, business strategy, cluster analysis"
"Abstract: Securing the access to a server, guaranteeing a certain level of protection over an encrypted communication channel, executing particular counter measures when attacks are detected are examples of security requirements. Such requirements are identified based on organizational purposes and expectations in terms of resource access and availability and also on system vulnerabilities and threats. All these requirements belong to the so-called security policy. Deploying the policy means enforcing, i.e., configuring, those security components and mechanisms so that the system behavior be finally the one specified by the policy. The deployment issue becomes more difficult as the growing organizational requirements and expectations generally leave behind the integration of new security functionalities in the information system: the information system will not always embed the necessary security functionalities for the proper deployment of contextual security requirements. To overcome this issue, our solution is based on a central entity approach which takes in charge unmanaged contextual requirements and dynamically redeploys the policy when context changes are detected by this central entity. We also present an improvement over the OrBAC (Organization-Based Access Control) model. Up to now, a controller based on a contextual OrBAC policy is passive, in the sense that it assumes policy evaluation triggered by access requests. Therefore, it does not allow reasoning about policy state evolution when actions occur. The modifications introduced by our work overcome this limitation and provide a proactive version of the model by integrating concepts from action specification languages.","policy state evolution, orbac, dynamic deployment, it security, contextual orbac policy, so-called security policy, necessary security functionalities, authorization, security component, network security, information system, contextual security requirement, new security functionalities, security device, security requirement, policy evaluation, context-aware access control policy"
"After guanethidine had blocked the response of the cat nictitating membrane to sympathetic nerve stimulation, dexamphetamine restored the responses to all frequencies of stimulation. Dexamphetamine antagonized the sympathetic nerve block by guanethidine in the isolated sympathetically innervated rabbit ileum; the evidence suggests that the antagonism was competitive. Dexamphetamine antagonized the sympathetic nerve block by guanethidine in the isolated hypogastric nerve-vas deferens preparation of the guinea-pig. Doses of dexamphetamine, larger than those required to antagonize the blocking action of guanethidine, abolished the responses of the nictitating membrane, ileum and vas deferens to nerve stimulation. Dexamphetamine did not influence the depletion of noradrenaline by guanethidine in the heart and spleen of rabbits. The hypothesis is advanced that both dexamphetamine and guanethidine act on the store of noradrenaline at sympathetic nerve endings.","dextro amphetamine, guanethidine, nictitating membrane, sympatholytics"
"In 1982, Quisquater and Couvreur proposed an RSA variant, called RSA-CRT, based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem to speed up RSA decryption. In 1990, Wiener suggested another RSA variant, called Rebalanced-RSA, which further speeds up RSA decryption by shifting decryption costs to encryption costs. However, this approach essentially maximizes the encryption time since the public exponent e is generally about the same order of magnitude as the RSA modulus. In this paper, we introduce two variants of Rebalanced-RSA in which the public exponent e is much smaller than the modulus, thus reducing the encryption costs, while still maintaining low decryption costs. For a 1024-bit RSA modulus, our first variant (Scheme A) offers encryption times that are at least 2.6 times faster than that in the original Rebalanced-RSA, while the second variant (Scheme B) offers encryption times at least 3 times faster. In both variants, the decrease in encryption costs is obtained at the expense of slightly increased decryption costs and increased key generation costs. Thus, the variants proposed here are best suited for applications which require low costs in encryption and decryption.","lattice basis reduction, crt, encryption cost, trading decryption, decryption cost, encryption, rsa, rsa variant, public exponent e, digital signatures, cryptanalysis, rsa decryption, 1024-bit rsa modulus, rsa crt encryption digital signatures lattice basis reduction cryptanalysis, rsa modulus, low decryption cost, encryption time, original rebalanced-rsa, chinese remainder theorem, digital signature"
"1,790 postpartum women were asked about their breast-feeding attitude, physical and other attitudinal variables. Bivariate analyses were conducted between attitude and each of 38 other variables. Of the causally independent variables, education and occupation were the most strongly related to attitude, and along with doctor's preference were perhaps the most important influences on a mother's baby-feeding attitude. No physical or health measure was strongly related to attitude towards breast-feeding, although there were consistent associations between favourable attitudes and optimal categories of the physical and health variables.

"The ultimate load behavior of longitudinally stiffened girder webs under patch loading is studied here by means of a nonlinear finite element analysis. Large-deflection effects and initial shape imperfections are taken into account. The influence of the slenderness of the directly loaded web panel on the patch loading capacity is studied in depth, together with the size of the loaded flange. In addition, the influence of stiffener rigidity is also analyzed. This study was aimed at finding an optimum position of longitudinal stiffeners for patch loading. Currently, designers use the value recommended for bending, i.e. one-fifth of girder depth. The results presented here show that a stiffener located closer than one-tenth of the girder depth significantly increases the load carrying capacity of the plate girder due to a decrease in the slenderness ratio of the web panel between the loaded flange and the longitudinal stiffener.","patch loading, plate girders, longitudinal stiffener, ultimate load, finite element, carrying capacity"
"A sequence variant (rs7216389-T) near the ORMDL3 gene on chromosome 17q21 was recently found to be associated with childhood asthma. We sought to evaluate the effect of rs7216389-T on asthma subphenotypes and its correlation with expression levels of neighboring genes. The association of rs7216389-T with asthma was replicated in six European and one Asian study cohort (N=4917 cases N=34 589 controls). In addition, we found that the association of rs7216389-T was confined to cases with early onset of asthma, particularly in early childhood (age: 0-5 years OR=1.51, P=6.89.10(-9)) and adolescence (age: 14-17 years OR=1.71, P=5.47.10(-9)). A weaker association was observed for onset between 6 and 13 years of age (OR=1.17, P=0.035), but none for adult-onset asthma (OR=1.07, P=0.12). Cases were further stratified by sex, asthma severity and atopy status. An association with greater asthma severity was observed among early-onset asthma cases (P=0.0012), but no association with sex or atopy status was observed among the asthma cases. An association between sequence variants and the expression of genes in the 17q21 region was assessed in white blood cell RNA samples collected from Icelandic individuals (n=743). rs7216389 associated with the expression of GSDMB and ORMDL3 genes. However, other sequence variants showing a weaker association with asthma compared with that of rs7216389 were more strongly associated with the expression of both genes. Thus, the contribution of rs7216389-T to the development of asthma is unlikely to operate only through an impact on the expression of ORMDL3 or GSDMB genes.","EJHG, human genetics, DNA diagnosis, cytogenetics, clinical genetics, molecular genetics, linkage studies"
"Abstract: The question of fairness in wireless sensor networks is not studied very well. It is not unusual to observe in the literature fairness traded for low latency or reliability. However, a disproportional use of some critical nodes as relaying nodes can cause premature network fragmentation. This paper investigates fairness in multi-hop wireless sensor networks and proposes a topology control protocol that enables nodes to exhaust their energy fairly. Moreover, it demonstrates that whereas the number of neighboring nodes with which a node should cooperate depends on the density of the network, increasing this number beyond a certain amount does not contribute to network connectivity.","disproportional use, literature fairness, low latency, efficiency metrics, multi-hop wireless, certain amount, wireless sensor network, network connectivity, topology control protocol, sensor network, critical node, premature network fragmentation"
"A multimedia system used as an auxiliary didactic tool for teaching medical genetics, HGEN, is based on non-linear programmed instruction and multimedia. HGEN was implemented in layers for PC compatible using MULTIMEDIA TOOLBOOK and DELPHI. It includes basic medical genetics concepts (inheritance patterns and cytogenetics) and it is based on multiple choice questions with images, diagrams and animations. The student-program interaction occurs by choosing an alternative in a question and receiving a specific answer as feedback and additional information. Links send the students to a glossary, to short descriptions of diseases used as examples, or to references for further studies. In order to evaluate the performance of the HGEN the authors used two questionnaires: (a) about the students' background in using computers; and (b) the system efficiency as a didactic tool, the software quality and user satisfaction. HGEN was used by 63 students from three medical schools and it was considered efficient as a learning tool (100%). Furthermore the implementation of a navigation map for frequencies analysis of followed path enable the study to detect structure and content inadequacies that could be correct for version 1.1 and proved to be an efficient tool to optimize a didactic software.","genetics, multimedia, software evaluation, medical education, software quality, non linear programming, multiple choice question, frequency analysis"
"Lattice microwave towers and transmission towers are frequently made of angles bolted together directly or through gussets. Such towers are normally analysed to obtain design forces using the linear static methods, assuming the members to be subjected to only axial loads and the deformations to be small. The effects of the end restraints, eccentricity of connections and secondary bracings (redundants) on the strength of the compression members are usually accounted for in the codal recommendations by modifying the effective length of the members and thus the design compressive strength. Hence, forces in the redundants are not known from the analysis and their design is empirical. In this study, non-linear analysis of angle compression members and the single panel of angle planar as well as three-dimensional lattice frames, as in typical lattice towers, are carried out using MSC-NASTRAN software. Account is taken of member eccentricity, local deformation as well as rotational rigidity of joints, beam-column effects and material non-linearity. The analytical models are calibrated with test results. Using this calibrated model, parametric studies are carried out to evaluate the forces in the redundants. The results are compared with codal provisions and recommendations for the design of redundants are presented.","non-linear analysis, secondary bracings, compression members, lattice towers, compressive strength, three dimensional"
"Health managers, administrators and health practitioners now face new challenges due to the increasing dependency being placed on electronic health information systems. This paper focuses on Electronic Health Records for determining the critical attributes for e-health system development. The proposed QUiPS model aims to provide a framework for building trustworthy solutions by identifying the pertinent issues needed to determine the risk exposure with a given system.To produce dependable, low risk and viable IT solutions, each critical attribute needs to be specifically addressed and prioritized. It is shown how these attributes possess a number of interdependencies making the analysis and prioritization tasks complex and hence, in practice, often incomplete. Two Australian case studies are presented that access enterprise level applications of live health records where these risk based techniques have been applied.The value and the shortcomings of taking a risk based approach to developing and deploying electronic health information systems that are safe and secure, is evaluated. The case studies presented indicate that traditional methods used to derive the requirements are often inadequate and the risks that are faced in ensuring a safe and secure system are highly application dependent and dynamic.Convergence towards a viable universal solution for our electronic health records is not imminent and trust in e-health is fragile. Policies that data custodians follow need to be flexible and updated on a regular basis. Technological solutions are at best a stop gap to avoid the common hazards associated with access control and secure messaging. A wider range of analysis techniques to determine the key issues for a dependable health information system can derive longer term sustainable solutions.","public health informatics, risk analysis, acceptability of health care, personal health records, personal health records acceptability of health care public health informatics e-health risk analysis, e-health, health, e"

"The interest of the international gastrointestinal endoscopy community in developing standards for endoscopic reporting resulted in a standard lexicon for describing endoscopic findings. It became clear that in order to facilitate the widespread use of this lexicon, a messaging standard which could link images to text had to be adopted.

These two standards should expand the ability of DICOM to accomodate endoscopic images and the clinical description of these images.","dicom, terminology, computers, standards, images, endoscopy, visible light"
"Making miniature holes of acceptable tolerances in titanium alloys by conventional drilling is difficult due to frequent tool failure because of its poor thermal conductivity, high hardness, and high chemical affinity with cutting tool materials. Micro-electrical discharge machining (micro-EDM) has been found as a suitable method of machining of miniature holes in titanium alloys but it faces some problems such as improper flushing of the debris, arcing, short-circuiting, frequent adhesion of tool electrode with workpiece, and poor machining rate. To overcome all these problems, authors have developed a new ultrasonic-assisted micro-EDM setup and fitted to already available ZNC-EDM machine. The objective of the present work is to study experimentally the effect of gap current (I g), pulse on-time (T on), pulse off-time (T off), and ultrasonic power (U P) on material removal rate (MRR), tool wear rate (TWR), and hole taper (T a) due to ultrasonic-assisted hole sinking micro-EDM (UA-HS-MEDM) in titanium alloy workpiece. Experimental results reveal that introduction of ultrasonic vibration in hole sinking micro-EDM (HS-MEDM) has significant effect on MRR, TWR, and T a. A comparative observation regarding recast layer and circularity of microholes made by HS-MEDM with and without ultrasonic vibration has also been reported.","Ultrasonic-assisted hole sinking micro-EDM, Titanium alloy, MRR, TWR, Hole taper"
Nonoperative management of blunt abdominal trauma is widely accepted in pediatric patients. There are few factors prospectively available to predict reliably which children will not respond to nonoperative treatment.

"This study examines what Chinese firms are looking for from foreign partner contributions. It identifies strategic, organizational, and financial attributes that are important to Chinese business satisfaction with the performance of international cooperative ventures (ICVs). It finds that a foreign partner's strategic attributes, namely technological capability, foreign market power, and international marketing expertise, and its organizational attributes, including managerial skills and organizational reputation, are positively associated with ICV performance as perceived by Chinese firms. By contrast, financial attributes are not important to Chinese partners. Different from foreign firms in organizational contingencies and institutional constraints, Chinese firms are asymmetrical with foreign firms in terms of strategic needs for ICV formation and partner selection criteria. They select foreign partners based upon market expansion and knowledge acquisition considerations rather than transaction cost concerns.","chinese firms, joint ventures, partner selection, transaction cost"
"This paper tackles two questions related to software effort prediction. First, is it valuable to combine prediction techniques? Second, if so, how? Many commentators have suggested the use of more than one technique in order to support effort prediction, but to date there has been little or no empirical investigation to support this recommendation. Our analysis of effort data from a medical records information system reveals that there is little, or even negative, covariance between the accuracy of our three chosen prediction techniques, namely, expert judgment, least squares regression and case-based reasoning. This indicates that when one technique predicts poorly, one or both of the others tends to perform significantly better. This is a particularly striking result given the relative homogeneity of our data set. Consequently, searching for the single ""best"" technique, at least in this case, leads to a sub-optimal prediction strategy. The challenge then becomes one of identifying a means of determining a priori which prediction technique to use. Unfortunately, despite using a range of techniques including rule induction, we were unable to identify any simple mechanism for doing so. Nevertheless, we believe this remains an important research goal.","software effort prediction, combining technique, effort data, empirical investigation, chosen prediction technique, important research goal, prediction technique, software project management, effort prediction, multiple techniques, case-based reasoning, sub-optimal prediction strategy, empirical analysis, expert judgment, medical records, least square, case base reasoning, information system"
"CoMed is a prototype of a real-time collaborative medicine system that allows medical specialists to share patient records and to communicate with each other on the Internet.

"Passive signal detection using a deformable hydrophone array, in which the position of each sensor deviates randomly from a nominal or estimated location, is examined. A general detector, which adds the power of R arbitrary linear combinations of all hydrophone outputs, is proposed. This configuration permits division of the array into arbitrary sections or partitions. When a single section is used, the detector reduces to the standard form used with no uncertainty. Linear filters in the processor are chosen to optimize the deflection criterion. Using the same criterion, performance of optimal and several suboptimal detectors is examined as a function of uncertainty variance. Numerical results presented for a large planar array confirm the existence of practical detectors that are nearly optimal and clearly superior to the standard detector in this application","acoustic arrays, acoustic signal processing, filtering and prediction theory, hydrophones, signal detection, arbitrary linear combinations, deflection criterion, deformable hydrophone arrays, linear filters, optimal signal detectors, passive signal detection, planar array, sensor, suboptimal detectors"
"The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a complex and robust metabolic pathway that contributes to the regulation of many key cellular processes including the cell cycle, cell division, and response to external stimuli. Ubiquitin ligases, which tag proteins with ubiquitin, are opposed by deubiquitinase enzymes (DUBs). The relative activity of these enzymes allows for a dynamic balance that determines the abundance and activity of cellular proteins. Targeting the UPS in cancer has proven successful, as evidenced by use of bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, in multiple myeloma. However, no pharmacologic inhibitor of the upstream enzymes has yet to reach clinical trials for the treatment of malignancy. Here we present an in vitro DUB assay for use in drug discovery and development that provides a biologically relevant platform for screening and developing lead or tool compounds targeting DUBs.","Cancer, DUB, Deubiquitinase, Ubiquitin"
"Many medical journals, publishing in national languages, meet serious financial problems and difficulties when they attempt to become indexed in the international indices. Obviously, this not only affects the scientific quality of non-indexed medical journals (NIMJs) but also affects the awareness of the scientific community of topics with apparently local but potentially broader scientific significance. This is a reality for over 100 Greek medical journals, none of which has a life longer than 30 years or more than 2000 subscribers. Among them, the 'Archives of Hellenic Medicine' (AHM) is published and sponsored by the Athens Medical Society (the oldest medical society in Greece founded in 1835). This peer-reviewed Journal is being published for 13 years, bimonthly, in Greek. Attempting to overcome the above mentioned problems and to be involved in the process of discovering the most effective way of scientific 'skywriting', 2 years ago, the AHM entered full-text in the Web and it was decided that up to 500% of its volume should be covered by English-language papers. As a result, the AHM are now included in the main Web lists of medical journals and their home page is linked in many academic pages having approximately 500 hits/month. Furthermore, 45 retrievals of AHM's English-language papers or English abstracts of Greek-language articles were reported by e-mail response from abroad. Considered apart from the paper-publishing, the expenses of the digital publishing of the AHM are about half of those of paper-publishing, as they were before the appearance of the Journal in the Web. Up to now, about 40% of the Journal's digital publishing cost is covered by advertisements included in its pages and by a modification of its paper-publishing policy. It is concluded that the international scientific community is not indifferent for information published in NIMJs. Medical national minorities working abroad express special interest for this type of information. The Web makes the NIMJs accessible to these potential readers, who would never have the chance to acquire them in their printed form.","medical journals, indexing, internet publication, english language, indexation"
"The use of dynamic dependence analysis spans several areas of software research including software testing, debugging, fault localization, and security. Many of the techniques devised in these areas require the execution of large test suites in order to generate profiles that capture the dependences that occurred between given types of program elements. When the aim is to capture direct and indirect dependences between finely granular elements, such as statements and variables, this process becomes highly costly due to: (1) the large number of elements, and (2) the transitive nature of the indirect dependence relationship. The focus of this paper is on computing dynamic dependences between variables, i.e., dynamic information flow analysis or DIFA. First, because the problem of tracking dependences between statements, i.e., dynamic slicing, has already been addressed by numerous researchers. Second, because DIFA is a more difficult problem given that the number of variables in a program is unbounded. We present an algorithm that, in the context of test suite execution, leverages the already computed dependences to efficiently compute subsequent dependences within the same or later test runs. To evaluate our proposed algorithm, we conducted an empirical comparative study that contrasted it, with respect to efficiency, to three other algorithms: (1) a naive basic algorithm, (2) a memoization based algorithm that does not leverage computed dependences from previous test runs, and (3) an algorithm that uses reduced ordered binary decision diagrams (roBDDs) to maintain and manage dependences. The results indicated that our new DIFA algorithm performed considerably better in terms of both runtime and memory consumption.","previous test, dynamic information flow analysis, new difa algorithm, test suite profiling, variables dependence, computed dependence, large test suite, proposed algorithm, dynamic dependence, memoization, later test, naive basic algorithm, dynamic dependence analysis span, flow analysis, comparative study, software testing, dependence analysis"
"The effect of reconstruction filters on direct upconversion is analyzed in a multichannel environment. It is shown that the reconstruction filters cause gain and phase imbalances to be frequency dependent, a significant issue when considering the stringent adjacent channel interference (ACI) requirements for radio communication systems. The paper introduces an adaptive compensation technique as a means of overcoming these frequency dependent imbalances. Additionally the error vector between the mismatched filters is shown to be directly related to the amount of sideband rejection. This analysis is then used to develop a methodology for analysing the performance of the novel compensation technique with respect to the mismatched filters. Analysis of the classical all-pole filter algorithms reveal the sensitivity of direct upconversion in a multichannel environment to filter order, type, percentage mismatch and differing ACI level","adjacent channel interference, filtering theory, frequency convertors, modulators, radiofrequency filters, signal reconstruction, telecommunication channels, adaptive compensation technique, adjacent channel interference, all-pole filter algorithms, analog quadrature modulator, direct upconversion, error vector, frequency dependent imbalances, gain imbalance, mismatched filters, multichannel environment, performance, phase imbalance, radio communication systems, reconstruction filters, sideband rejection"
"Based on the Generalised Beam Theory(GBT) ,two computing models are presented to analyse the distortional critical stress of cold-formed thin-walled inclined lipped channel beams bending about the minor axis.The computing model of rigid-body motion ignores the transverse bending deformation of the flange.However,the bending deformation of the flange is accounted for in the transverse bending computing model.Based on the transverse bending computing model,this paper puts up a simple method to take into account the in-plane bending of the flange.The results given by the rigid-body motion computing model does not correlate as well as those given by the transverse bending computing model with the results available in the literature.The accuracy of the transverse bending computing model is verified through comparison of its results with the known results.The comparisons demonstrate the importance of the bending deformation of the flange on the distortional buckling of cold-formed thin-walled channel beams bending about the minor axis.","warping, transverse bending deformation, beams bending about the minor axis, cold-formed thin-walled inclined lipped channels, generalised beam theory(gbt), distortional buckling, computer model, rigid body motion"
"This paper discusses some policies for performance-reliability improvement in distributed file systems. File replication, file migration, and process migration are considered, and the decision whether to replicate a file, or to move a file or a process, is based on the workload demands on the system resources. The utilization of system components, especially that of the communication network, is important, and the system bottleneck and the hosts' bottlenecks are detected. A model of a distributed system is constructed and consists of a number of hosts connected by a communication network. Concurrency control policy allows transaction type access to the shared resources. A unit of concurrency control (i.e., entity to be locked) is a sector of a file. Concurrency control policy is a single writer or multiple readers. Two-phase locking protocol is used for transaction serialization.","process migration, system bottleneck, file system, transaction type access, system resource, transaction serialization, concurrency control, performance-reliability issue, system component, communication network, concurrency control policy, distributed file system"
"Preparation of NWA-II molecular sieve adsorbent was modified. The pore structure and liquid dynamic adsorption characteristics of prepared adsorbents were tested. The results indicated that modification could yield the adsorbent with a decreased BET surface area, an increased average pore diameter for adsorption and a much more rapid adsorption rate. As compared to NWA-II, the modified NWA-II adsorbent exhibited higher adsorption capacity, which is approximately equal to that of imported adsorbent ADS-34.","Adsorbent, Adsorption properties, Molecular sieve, Pore structure"
"Based on the engineering background of No.9303 stope in Nantun Coal mine,the mechanical mechanism of mine quake induced by the mutation of horizontal stress on the isolated island's fully mechanized caving face is studied.By simplifying hard rock in overlying strata into a mechanical model of elastic rectangular thin plates with simply supported and clamped beasms and by imposing horizontal stress caused by extraction to the clamped sides,namely the mechanical model with the elastic rectangular thin plates with simply supported and clamped beams under the action of horizontal stress,the distribution of stress and deflection of the overlying strata of hard rock is analyzed on the caving face of No.9303 stope,and the limitation of the caving step length of the roof of the overlying strata of hard rock is studied.Based on this,the drawing pace which causes coal outburst induced by mine quake is predicted.Then the pressure is released for the predicted dangerous areas.When 2.6-level mine quake happens in the predicted areas,there is no disaster,which proves that the mine quake caused by the crack of the roof of the thick layer may be predicted.","Elastic thin plate, Hard overlying stratum, Horizontal stress, Mechanical model, Mine quake"
"Total soluble sugar, reducing sugar, non-reducing sugar and starch contents of wheat, maize and sorghum grains were affected adversely at 25, 50 and 75% insect infestation caused by Trogoderma granarium Everts and Rhizopertha dominica Fabricius, separately and mixed population. R. dominica caused significant (P < 0.05) reduction in available carbohydrates at 50 and 75% infestation levels whereas T. granarium achieved similar effect at 75%. Mixture of both insect species caused intermediate losses. Storage of cereal grains up to 4 months resulted in substantial increase in sugars and decrease in starch content, but storage for a shorter period of time did not cause any significant changes in levels of carbohydrates.","cereal grain, insect infestation, carbohydrates, storage"
"The regulatory and commercial framework for the introduction of a cellular radio system in the UK is unusual, in that it calls for two competing networks to interwork interchangeably with a range of mobile units. Connection to the fixed telephone network is also required. The Total Access Communication System (TACS) has been defined to meet such conditions. A description is given of the bases for the determination of the overall system parameters, particularly those concerned with the radio paths and end-to-end speech transmission. The definition of the key interfaces to permit interworking without restricting competitive technological development is also outlined.","cellular radio, legislation, TACS, Total Access Communication System, UK, cellular mobile radio system, commercial framework, end-to-end speech transmission, fixed telephone network, interworking, mobile units, radio paths, regulatory framework"
"Scalability, flexibility, quality of service provisioning, efficiency and robustness are the desired characteristics of most computing systems. Although the emerging Grid computing paradigm is scalable and flexible, achieving both efficiency and quality of service provisioning in Grids is a challenging task but is necessary for the wide adoption of Grids. Grid middleware should also be robust to uncertainties such as those in user-estimated runtimes of Grid applications. In this paper, we present a complete middleware framework for Grids that achieves user satisfaction by providing QoS guarantees for Grid applications, cost effectiveness by efficiently utilizing resources and robustness by intelligently handling uncertain runtimes of applications.","grid middleware, grid resource management, challenging task, cost effectiveness, computing system, multi-organizational grids, grid application, achieving efficiency, qos guarantee, quality of service in distributed systems, grid computing paradigm, uncertain runtimes, complete middleware framework, uncertain runtimes management, user-estimated runtimes, grid scheduling, middleware, grid computing, resource manager, quality of service, distributed system"
"Based on fractal theory, the fractal characteristics of graded aggregate in asphalt mixture were studied, and aggregate particle fractal dimension, aggregate particle size distribution fractal dimension, aggregate mass-grading fractal dimension and aggregate volume fractal dimension were discussed. The research results show that the complex outer aggregate structure in asphalt mixture can be quantitatively described by fractal dimension, under bi-logarithm coordinates there was a linear relation between aggregate perimeter and aggregate area value, fractal dimensions were very close among the same aggregate source but different aggregate gradations, fractal dimensions were also very close among the same aggregate source but on different cross sections in asphalt mixture, there were different fractal dimensions among different aggregate sources; aggregate particle size distribution, aggregate mass-grading distribution, aggregate volume distribution and voids distribution in aggregate also can be quantitatively described by fractal dimension, and with the increase of aggregate mass-grading fractal dimension aggregate gradation became coarser.","Asphalt mixture, Fractal dimension, Graded aggregate, Road engineering"
"The drive to rapidly develop layered, interconnected, and flexible systems has eclipsed consideration of resource costs. Consequently, large Java applications suffer from runtime bloat: a large and pervasive infrastructure tax, where simple transactions require a few hundred thousand method calls, and a server with 1 Gbyte of memory sometimes can only support a few hundred users. Current Java optimizers and garbage collectors are of little help for these systemic problems. Enterprises face greatly reduced scalability, increased power consumption, and missed deliveries. In this article, the authors detail four global software development trends, along with some widely held myths, that lead to bloat in Java applications. They illustrate their consequences with anecdotes drawn from real applications suffering severe performance and memory issues. While these trends are inevitable, runtime bloat is not. Understanding the sources of bloat can help programmers craft appropriate solutions for the future.","hundred user, java application, java runtime bloat, appropriate solution, runtime bloat, eclipsed consideration, hundred thousand method call, current java optimizers, large java application, authors detail, memory issue, xml, software construction, metrics, software engineering, data storage, system integration, data integrity, measurements, object oriented, data integration, java"
"This study evaluates how state regulation of noncompetition agreements affects merger and acquisition activity. Noncompetition agreements put restrictions on postemployment activities, thereby reducing management mobility and forcing top managers to bear the long-term consequences of their corporate decisions. In this sense, state regulation of noncompetition agreements functions as a mechanism to align management's interests with those of the shareholders when management makes major corporate decisions. To examine this hypothesis empirically, this study tests whether the legal enforcement of noncompetition agreements across states affects the choice of payment methods, the premium paid for targets, and the acquirers' abnormal returns on their merger or acquisition activity. The results suggest that stricter enforcement of noncompetition agreements significantly reduces the likelihood of using stock in takeovers and the premiums paid for targets. In addition, the study documents that stronger enforcement of noncompetition agreements is related with more favorable market reactions for large acquirers.","corporate governance, acquirer returns, noncompetition agreements, managerial labor market"
"A common problem in software cost estimation is the manipulation of incomplete or missing data in databases used for the development of prediction models. In such cases, the most popular and simple method of handling missing data is to ignore either the projects or the attributes with missing observations. This technique causes the loss of valuable information and therefore may lead to inaccurate cost estimation models. On the other hand, there are various imputation methods used to estimate the missing values in a data set. These methods are applied mainly on numerical data and produce continuous estimates. However, it is well known that the majority of the cost data sets contain software projects with mostly categorical attributes with many missing values. It is therefore reasonable to use some estimating method producing categorical rather than continuous values. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the possibility of using such a method for estimating categorical missing values in software cost databases. Specifically, the method known as multinomial logistic regression (MLR) is suggested for imputation and is applied on projects of the ISBSG multi-organizational software database. Comparisons of MLR with other techniques for handling missing data, such as listwise deletion (LD), mean imputation (MI), expectation maximization (EM) and regression imputation (RI) under different patterns and percentages of missing data, show the high efficiency of the proposed method.","simple method, categorical missing value, imputation, software cost estimation, multinomial logistic regression, cost data set, categorical missing data imputation, missing data, various imputation method, missing observation, numerical data, software effort prediction, missing value, cost estimation, missing values, expectation maximization, prediction model"
The aim of this paper is to test the hypothesis that the effect of alcohol consumption on suicide risk is stronger in Sweden than in France. The rationale of the hypothesis is that we should expect a difference between the two countries with respect to: (i) the composition of alcohol abusers; and (ii) the degree to which heavy drinking is accepted. Analyses of time-series data provide support for the hypothesis: the effect of per capita consumption of alcohol is significantly stronger in Sweden than in France.,"human factors, comparative analysis, injury prevention, occupational safety, ergonomics, suicide prevention"
"When their products or services reached the mature stage of life cycle, many telecommunications firms started to form alliance partnering with companies in other industries such as movie theaters and fast food restaurants. They offer discounts to their consumers when they buy products or services from their partnering companies. We show that, even in markets where the total demand does not grow, such co-promotion partnering with companies in different industries can benefit allied firms as well as target consumers who buy products or services from the allied firms. The benefits come from discriminating prices between consumers in price-sensitive segments and price-insensitive segments.","alliance, co-promotion, price sensitivity, segmentation, price discrimination, life cycle"
"The geodesic interval function I of a connected graph allows an axiomatic characterization involving axioms on the function only, without any reference to distance, as was shown by Nebesky [20]. Surprisingly, Nebesky [23] showed that, if no further restrictions are imposed, the induced path function J of a connected graph G does not allow such an axiomatic characterization. Here J(u,v) consists of the set of vertices lying on the induced paths between u and v. This function is a special instance of a transit function. In this paper we address the question what kind of restrictions could be imposed to obtain axiomatic characterizations of J. The function J satisfies betweenness if w@?J(u,v), with wu, implies u@?J(w,v) and x@?J(u,v) implies J(u,x)@?J(u,v). It is monotone if x,y@?J(u,v) implies J(x,y)@?J(u,v). In the case where we restrict ourselves to functions J that satisfy betweenness, or monotonicity, we are able to provide such axiomatic characterizations of J by transit axioms only. The graphs involved can all be characterized by forbidden subgraphs.","induced path, domino, long cycle, induced path function, transit axiom, axiomatic characterization, special instance, transit function, geodesic interval function, functions j, betweenness, function j, connected graph, monotone, house, p -graph, p, satisfiability"
"The teaching of medical informatics is of importance for students in medicine and health care, realizing that they will be the health professionals of the future. Training in medical informatics is also of value for practicing clinicians who are overwhelmed by the avalanche of systems that are available on the market. Some examples of operational systems are presented here to indicate that health care has changed dramatically over the last decades. This paper intends to contribute to the drafting of IMIA guidelines for teaching medical informatics by (1) reporting on the experience at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of the Erasmus University Rotterdam as part of the curriculum, (2) reporting on the implementation of guidelines for teaching medical informatics in The Netherlands since these guidelines were drafted in 1986, and (3) by introducing the teaching material contained in the new Handbook of Medical Informatics and on its Web site.","training, curriculum, handbook, guidelines, medical informatics, web site, health care, operating system"
"Organic static induction transistors (OSIT) with schottky gate electrode of Au/CuPc/Al/CuPc/Au sandwich structure are fabricated by the method of vacuum evaporation and the evaporated films of organic semiconductor copper-phthalocyanine (CuPc) as the active layers. The conductor channel of OSIT perpendicular to the surface of the CuPc film is largely shorter than that of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistor (MOSFET), which avails to overcome the shortcoming of electrical characteristics of organic semiconductor. The experimental results manifest the low driver voltage and no-saturated current-voltage characteristics of OSIT. The working properties depend on the gate bias voltage and the structure of pectinate Al electrode. Good static and dynamic characteristics of OSIT are obtained by properly designing the structure of pectinate Al electrode.","Copper phthalocyanine, Organic semiconductor, Thin film transistor, Vacuum evaporate"
"A model for the design of gradient ceramic nozzle materials is presented. The purpose is to reduce the tensile stress at the entry region of the nozzle during sand blasting processes. A (W, Ti)C/SiC gradient ceramic nozzle material, GN-1, was accordingly synthesized by hot pressing according to the design result. The residual thermal stress of the (W, Ti)C/SiC gradient ceramic nozzle in the fabricating process was calculated by means of the finite element method (FEM). The design of composition distribution of the gradient ceramic nozzle was carried out with the aim of partial relaxation of the stress resulting from external loadings by residual thermal stress. The erosion behavior of the gradient ceramic nozzle was investigated in comparison with the common ceramic nozzles. It is suggested that gradient structure in ceramic nozzles is an effective way to improve the erosion wear resistance over the common ceramic nozzles.

"This paper focuses on the application of the reflective practitioner (RP) perspective to the profession of software engineering (SE). The RP perspective guides professional people to rethink their professional creations during and after the accomplishment of the creation process. Analysis of the field of SE supports the adoption of the RP perspective to SE in general and to SE education in particular. The RP perspective emphasizes the studio--the basic training method in architecture schools--as the educational environment for design studies. In such studios students develop projects with a close guidance of a tutor. Analysis of the kind of tasks that architecture students are working on and a comparison of these tasks to the problems that SE students are facing, suggest that the studio may be an appropriate teaching method in SE as well. The paper presents the main ideas of the RP perspective and examines its fitness to SE in general and to SE education in particular. The discussion is based on analysis of the RP perspective and of the SE profession, visits to architecture studios, and conversations with tutors in architecture studios and with computing science practitioners.","appropriate teaching method, se student, rp perspective, studios student, se profession, architecture studio, reflective practitioner perspective, architecture school, architecture student, se education, software engineering education, rp perspective guide, teaching methods, software engineering"
"Estimating the amount of effort required for developing an information system is an important project management concern. The author has developed a model that estimates small-scale software development effort in 4GL and end-user computing environments. In addition to presenting and evaluating the proposed model, this paper evaluates two of the most popular models currently used to estimate software development effort i.e., lines of code (LOC), and function points (FP). Results of the study show a significant correlation between the software development effort and all three models. Compared to LOC and FP models, the models developed in this research are less costly and easier to use in a small-scale software development environment.","small-scale business application, software development environment, information system, function point, software development, end user computing, lines of code"
"The aim of this paper is to study the stress concentration factors of concrete-filled tubular T joints subject to axial loading and in-plane bending. Experimental investigation was performed to investigate the Hot Spot Stress distribution along the intersection of chord and brace. Five tubular T joint specimens with self compacting concrete-filled chords were tested. In addition, three hollow steel tubular T joint specimens were also tested for comparison. Generally, it is shown that the concrete filling effectively reduces the peak stress concentration factors. The stress concentration factors obtained from the test results were compared against predictions from some well-established existing stress concentration factor equations. Generally, the predictions from those equations are very conservative for concrete-filled specimens.","stress concentration factor, concrete-filled steel tubes, experiment investigation, t joints, hot spot"
"This paper presents an overview of the mechanics of distortion in members which have restrained thin-walled steel sections. First, the basic features that characterize the distortion of thin-walled sections under compression and/or bending are explained and the generally adopted kinematical assumptions are presented and discussed. On the basis of these assumptions, a simple procedure to build the distortional displacement fields is proposed. Then, two illustrative examples of restrained sections are given and their distortional displacement fields are built. The I-section illustrates the case of a symmetric section having a distortional displacement field with a single d.o.f. The Z-section exemplifies the case of a non symmetric section having a distortional field with two d.o.f. Based on an energy formulation, the equilibrium equation for buckling analysis of simply supported thin-walled members is derived. For two illustrative examples, the distortional displacement field is used to obtain distortional analytical formulae. Finally, some results (buckling loads and moments) were determined and validated by means of comparison with fully numerical obtained from finite strip analysis.","Restrained thin-walled steel sections, Analytical formula, Z-sections, I-sections, Distortional mechanics, Kinematical assumptions, Distortional buckling"

This single case study suggests that there may be an association of the Fragile-X abnormality with dyslexia or primary learning disability, suggesting a genetic etiology for primary dyslexia.","fragile-x syndrome, learning disability, autism, dyslexia"
"This paper presents two-dimensional laboratory experiments performed to study how groundwater flow may affect the injected air zone of influence and remedial performance, and how injected air may alter subsurface groundwater flow and contaminant migration during in situ air sparging. Tests were performed by subjecting uniform sand profiles contaminated with dissolved-phase benzene to a hydraulic gradient and two different air flow rates. The results of the tests were compared to a test subjected to a similar air flow rate but a static groundwater condition. The test results revealed that the size and shape of the zone of influence were negligibly affected by groundwater flow, and as a result, similar rates of contaminant removal were realized within the zone of influence with and without groundwater flow. The air flow, however, reduced the hydraulic conductivity within the zone of influence, reducing groundwater flow and subsequent downgradient contaminant migration. The use of a higher air flow rate further reduced the hydraulic conductivity and decreased groundwater flow and contaminant migration. Overall, this study demonstrated that air sparging may be effectively implemented to intercept and treat a migrating contaminant plume.","vocs, saturated soils, groundwater flow, groundwater remediation, in situ air sparging, air flow"
"We present a latent hierarchical structural learning method for object detection. An object is represented by a mixture of hierarchical tree models where the nodes represent object parts. The nodes can move spatially to allow both local and global shape deformations. The models can be trained discriminatively using latent structural SVM learning, where the latent variables are the node positions and the mixture component. But current learning methods are slow, due to the large number of parameters and latent variables, and have been restricted to hierarchies with two layers. In this paper we describe an incremental concave-convex procedure (iCCCP) which allows us to learn both two and three layer models efficiently. We show that iCCCP leads to a simple training algorithm which avoids complex multi-stage layer-wise training, careful part selection, and achieves good performance without requiring elaborate initialization. We perform object detection using our learnt models and obtain performance comparable with state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on challenging public PASCAL datasets. We demonstrate the advantages of three layer hierarchies - outperforming Felzenszwalb et al.'s two layer models on all 20 classes.","local shape deformations, trees (mathematics), svm learning, learning (artificial intelligence), global shape deformations, latent hierarchical structural learning method, convex programming, concave programming, node positions, object detection, mixture component, hierarchical tree models, support vector machines, incremental concave-convex procedure"
"To ensure that patient confidentiality is securely maintained, health ICT applications that contain sensitive personal information demand comprehensive privacy policies. Determining the adequacy of these policies to meet legal conformity together with clinical users and patient expectation is demanding in practice. Organisations and agencies looking to analyse their Privacy and Security policies can benefit from guidance provided by outside entities such as the Privacy Office of their State or Government together with law firms and ICT specialists. The advice given is not uniform and often open to different interpretations. Of greater concern is the possibility of overlooking any important aspects that later result in a data breach. Based on three case studies, this paper considers whether a more formal approach to privacy analysis could be taken that would help identify the full coverage of a Privacy Impact Analysis and determine the deficiencies with an organisation's current policies and approach. A diagrammatic model showing the relationships between Confidentiality, Privacy, Trust, Security and Safety is introduced. First the validity of this model is determined by mapping it against the real-world case studies taken from three healthcare services that depend on ICT. Then, by using software engineering methods, a formal mapping of the relationships is undertaken to identify a full set of policies needed to satisfy the model. How effective this approach may prove as a generic method for deriving a comprehensive set of policies in health ICT applications is finally discussed.","privacy, security, privacy policy, trust, software engineering, security policy, ehealth, satisfiability, confidentiality"
"The aim of the study was to describe current treatment and trends in surgical management of pediatric inguinal hernias (IHs), specifically contralateral exploration.Surveys were sent to 599 Surgical Section members. Questions paralleled the 1993 American Academy of Pediatrics survey and addressed recent controversial topics. Statistical analysis by chi2 was performed.Three hundred ninety-five (66%) surveys returned. For full-term boys with reducible IH, 79% (82%) repair electively, regardless of age or weight. For full-term girls with reducible ovary, 49% (27%) repair electively, 36% (59%) next available slot, 5% (10%) emergently (P < .01). In former premature infants, 53% (65%) repair reducible IH when convenient, regardless of age. For unilaterally presenting IH, 44% (65%) routinely explore contralateral groins in boys 2 years or younger (P < .01); 47% (84%) routinely explore girls 4 years or younger (P < .01). No significant association between routine exploration patterns and years in practice, region of country, or training program affiliation was found. Laparoscopic evaluation for contralateral IH was reported by 37% (6%), (P < .01) 1993 results italicized.Reports of routine contralateral inguinal exploration had absolute decreases of 21% for boys 2 years or younger, 37% for girls 4 years or younger.

"In light of the rapid growth of international marketing studies, we thought it timely to investigate recent patterns and developments in the literature. We performed a content analysis of nearly 600 articles published from 1990 to 2000 in the leading academic journals. It became clear that major progress has been made in terms of a broadened research agenda and greater technical rigor. However, opportunities were identified to address overlooked research topics, increase cross-national collaboration, strengthen the complexity and comprehensiveness of theories, as well as diversify research methods beyond surveys. Based on these findings, we outlined several directions for advancement of international marketing knowledge.","international marketing, method, theory, literature review, content analysis"
"Inflammation is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is consistently associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Clinical event rates increase with declining renal function and activation of the acute-phase response. Statins are potent anti-inflammatory drugs that reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events. Owing to the increased prevalence of inflammation in patients with CKD and the potent effect of statins in individuals with elevated levels of C-reactive protein, these drugs should be especially effective in patients with CKD. Whereas data indicate that pravastatin may prevent loss of kidney function to a greater extent in individuals with evidence of increased inflammation than in those who show no inflammation, two large, randomized statin trials in patients on hemodialysis found no benefit of statin therapy, neither in the whole study group nor after stratifying for inflammation. Irrespective of inflammation, guidelines recommend treatment of dyslipidemia in early stages of CKD, which is supported by results from recent meta-analyses, and the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP), a large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","renal function, controlled trial, acute phase response, kidney function"

"This article examines the implications that the moment of market entry has for the effect of capabilities and competitive tactics on firm performance, using a sample of 253 companies from the information and communications technology industry. The results show that technical capabilities and low cost orientation are learning factors in the firms' performance, regardless of the moment of entry into the market. The study shows how the two perspectives of competitive strategy and resource-based view complement each other to incorporate different competitive factors in a coherent model for the study of entry timing. The study takes the sustainability model of competitive advantage further, by demonstrating that certain capabilities and competitive tactics can allow pioneers and early followers to achieve and maintain superior performance in a dynamic, hostile and with high level of imitation industry. This study also shows that the availability of a combination of marketing capabilities and low cost orientation will allow late followers' firms to take advantage of early entrants' mistakes.","entry timing, competitive advantage, resource-based view, capabilities, competitive tactics, firm performance, competitive strategy, information and communication technology"
"Based on the theory of Duffing oscillator, a new method of Doppler processing for pseudo random-code continuous wave (PRC-CW) radar signal in strong-clutter background is presented in this paper. By identifying the state of the chaotic oscillator system, Doppler frequency-shift is detected in order to calculate the speed of the target and solve the problem of Doppler sensitivity of pulse compression. At the same time, a fast method is introduced to accelerate identifying the states of the chaotic system. In order to estimate the phase of the Doppler component and prove the validity under stochastic phase, the influence of phase separation is also discussed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this new method.","doppler frequency-shift, duffing oscillator, prc-cw radar, pulse compression, oscillators, phase separation"
"A theory of domain knowledge is proposed that consists of `grounded domains' that model a set of cooperating objects that achieve a purpose. Grounded domains have spatial presence in the real world and contain agents that act on objects within a context of structures. More complex meta-domains use grounded domains as their subject matter and describe education, management, etc. The third component of the theory, generic tasks, describes problem solving activity such as diagnosis, searching, planning and scheduling. Generic tasks describe the behavioural components in both grounded and meta-domains. The reusable library of generic models is applied to the design of interactive systems by reusing the models as templates, and to reuse design knowledge in the form of associated design rationale. A process for recognising generic models is described with recognition heuristics structured in a walkthrough type of analysis for identifying key abstractions in new applications. The design process is illustrated with an information retrieval case study developed as a decision support system for emergency management, reusing information searching services. The discussion reviews the prospects for reusable patterns in interactive systems design, and similar approaches in software and knowledge engineering.","software reuse, domain analysis, design rationale, information retrieval, knowledge engineering, domain knowledge, emergency management, design process"
"For a number of years there has been a debate about the appropriateness of formocresol as a vital pulpotomy material, there being concerns regarding the safety of its principal component, formaldehyde. Therefore, there is great interest in the effectiveness of alternative materials. This systematic review and meta-analysis provides useful information on the effectiveness of one alternative material, ferric sulphate, when compared to formocresol. The paper starts with a lengthy, well-written synopsis on evidence-based dentistry; however, this is somewhat superfluous in this paper. The paper refers in the last paragraph to the existing Cochrane Systematic Review,1 calling it brief, but noting that these two reviews both conclude that ""there is no reliable evidence supporting the superiority of one particular treatment method for pulpally involved primary molars."" It would have been valuable if this review had spent more time discussing the Cochrane Review explaining the differences in approach and methodology of the two reviews. Other than these two criticisms, this is a well conducted and reported review. The trials were analyzed in two ways: those where formocresol and ferric sulphate were compared head to head (two trials), and trials reporting either technique (13 trials). There were more data available for formocresol than ferric sulphate. This review concluded that both pulpotomy techniques were likely to be successful and neither was more effective than the other, and emphasizes that vital pulpotomies work. Given the doubts about the safety of formocresol it would also appear that it is more appropriate to use ferric sulphate. However, anecdotally many clinicians feel that formocresol is more successful because it is not as technique sensitive as the alternatives. There is no evidence to support this view. Many questions remain: what is the most effective pulpotomy technique, should pulpectomy be used instead, or should a more biological approach of indirect pulp capping be advocated?2, 3 This excellent review provides a significant step forward both in terms of methodology and information.","ebd, transplantation, stem cells, progenitor cells, allografting, autografting, graft-versus-host disease"
"The role of continental water in polar motion excitation can be illustrated by determining Hydrological Angular Momentum calculated from terrestrial water storage (TWS). In this paper we compare global and regional changes in TWS computed using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate models, Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) land hydrology models and observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. We also compare hydrological excitation functions derived from models with those obtained from the GRACE mission and the hydrological signal in observed polar motion excitation (the so-called geodetic residuals). The results confirm that GLDAS models of seasonal and non-seasonal TWS change are more consistent with GRACE data than climate models; on the other hand, none of the considered models are fully consistent with GRACE data or geodetic residuals. In turn, GRACE observations are most consistent with the non-seasonal hydrological signal in observed excitation. A detailed study of the contribution of different TWS components to the hydrological excitation function shows that soil moisture dominates.","Terrestrial water storage, GRACE, Polar motion, GLDAS"
"Monomode fibers and long-wavelength lasers provide a practically unlimited transmission bandwidth over very long unrepeated distances. These unique properties open up new applications. Besides the conventional long-haul telecommunications carrier applications, new markets will develop in local networks to take advantage of the low maintenance costs, the flexibility, and the high privacy of repeaterless fiber optic links. A first example is Aetna Life and Casualty's private corporate network in the Hartford area, a wide area corporate network (WACN) designed to support: high-quality video transmission for Video conferencing or broadcasting; conventional voice and data communications; future highspeed data communications. Different aspects of the implementation of this WACN are presented. Another example, the interconnection of CATV franchises in the same area, is also discussed.","Videoconference, Data communication, Fiber lasers, Bandwidth, Costs, Privacy, Repeaters, Optical fibers, Multimedia communication, Broadcasting"
Change in academic units is essential but challenging to new deans. This article describes principles of change applied to academic departments in general and a specific description of how one well-established academic unit in nursing changed its administrative structure. The goal of the dean in creating a new structure was to facilitate faculty governance. The process used was one of faculty participation and involvement in decision making. Evaluation of the effectiveness of the new structure provided support for how well it was working and suggestions for refinement. The entire process and the reflection on how and when to make changes when one is new to the position of dean will provide insight for others in similar positions.,"faculty governance, academic administration, change, administrative structure, administrative leadership"
"This paper firstly introduced the basic principles of the induction filtering technology. Then, it analyzed the characteristics of the commutation reactance of the novel converter transformer, to answer whether the induction filtering technology impacted on the commutation reactance. A mathematic model and a simulation model were built to calculate the commutation reactance. The results show that the fundamental wave and the harmonics of the commutation current have not identical circuit owing to the inductive filtering technology, and thus traditional calculation methods may not be applicable any longer. This mathematic model not only applies to the novel converter transformer, but also applies to the traditional converter transformer. The inductive filtering technology can help reduce the commutation reactance of the novel converter transformer by about two-thirds.","Commutation failure, Commutation reactance, Direct current transmission, Inductive filtering, Novel converter transformer"
"Total RNA was extracted from venom glands of Agkistrodon acutus. The cDNA encoding Lys-49 phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) was amplified by reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The cDNA was cloned into the pGEMT-vector and sequenced. The open reading frame (ORF) of Lys-49 PLA 2 consists of 414 bp encoding 138 amino acids, which includes a signal peptide of 16 amino acids and a matured peptide of 122 amino acids. It shows 76% identity in amino acids with another reported Lys-49 PLA 2. Because residue 49 in mature peptide is Lysine, it probably possesses myotoxicity. These results indicate there are at least two kinds of myotoxin in the venom of A. acutus.","agkistrodon acutus, cdna sequence analysis, myotoxin, phospholipase a 2, signal peptide, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, open reading frame, sequence analysis, amino acid"
"During kidney development a multitude of tubular portions is formed. Little knowledge is available by which cellbiological mechanism a cluster of embryonic cells is able to generate the three-dimensional structure of a tubule. However, this know-how is most important in tissue engineering approaches such as the generation of an artificial kidney module or for the therapy of renal diseases using stem cells. To obtain cellbiological insights in parenchyme development we elaborate a new technique to generate under in vitro conditions renal tubules derived from the embryonic cortex of neonatal rabbits. The aim of the experiments is to establish a specific extracellular environment allowing optimal three-dimensional development of renal tubules under serum-free culture conditions. In the present paper we demonstrate features of the renal stem cell niche and show their isolation as intact microcompartments for advanced tissue culture. Perfusion culture in containers exhibiting a big dead fluid volume results in the development of a flat collecting duct (CD) epithelium at the surface of the tissue explant. In contrast, by fine-tuning the dead fluid volume within a perfusion culture container by an artificial interstitium made of a polyester fleece shows the generation of tubules. It is an up to date unknown morphogenetic information which tells the cells to form tubular structures.","epithelium, stem cell niche, tissue culture, renal stem cells, stem cell, tissue engineering"
"To enhance the reliability as well as the value of sensing data in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), a type of Energy-efficient Target Tracking Approach (ETTA) is proposed in this paper. The sensor network is divided into several virtual grids for distributed tracking and three kinds of states (tracking state, prepared-tracking state and preparing-tracking state) of these grids are also proposed to reduce energy consumption and enhance the accuracy of node localization. Moreover, a tracking recovery strategy is also described in this paper that effectively enhance the robustness of the tracking system. Experiment results show that ETTA has a good performance on target tracking in sensor networks compared to BPS and EMTT.","Sensor networks, Target tracking, Virtual grids, Energy-efficient, Network lifetime"
"Scored content of transcriptions of recordings of initial interviews with 70 patients at a psychiatric outpatient clinic was used to predict whether a patient would come back for at least 3 more interviews if offered treatment. Each sentence unit or 5 sec. of silence was assigned a rating of + (favorable to continuation), or - (unfavorable), or 0 (irrelevant). Excess of plus over minus units predicted continuation; excess of minus over plus units predicted dropping out. Coefficients of reliability of ratings by 3 pairs of scores were significant at .001. Individual scorers predicted correctly 73%, 81%, and 80% of cases; averages of paired scorers predicted 81% correctly; averages including scores of mediator predicted 83% correctly.

"The philosophy of performance based design of blast resistant offshore systems is an approach by which structural components are allowed to behave in a controlled non-linear characteristic that satisfies the demand criteria for preventing loss of lives, asset protection and integrity of escape routes. As the approach is based on behaviour rather than a prescriptive performance, uncertainties are removed which attributes to a precise design compared with a traditional design method. In the context of offshore installations, particularly for topside structures where safety cannot be compromised, this will lead to an economical design as well as meeting the functionality of a system from pre to post explosion regimes. This paper presents a performance based design philosophy for a typical topside structure which has the merit of being informative to the client and to regulators. This method also assists engineers in the comparison of engineering solutions which can be correlated to performance levels for which the installation has been designed and protected. The paper is divided into two sections. The first section discusses the methodology of the approach accompanied by a design algorithm assessment in which the principles of performance based design are emphasized in order to achieve the specific demand level for attainment of performance objectives. The second section demonstrates its application followed by a design example of a typical offshore topside to assess deck plate resistance against a defined blast load level.","risk, hydrocarbon explosions, performance level, ductility, demand level, overpressure, design method, satisfiability"
"In multirate digital signal processing, we often en- counter decimators, interpolators, and complicated interconnec- tions of these with LTI filters. We also encounter cyclo-wide-sense stationary (CWSS) processes and linear periodically time-varying (LPTV) systems. It is often necessary to understand the effects of multirate systems on the statistical properties of their input signals. Some of these issues have been addressed earlier. For example, it has been shown that a necessary and sufficient condition for the output of an -fold interpolation filter to be wide sense stationary (WSS) for all WSS inputs is that the filter have an alias-free ( ) support. However, several questions of this nature remain unanswered. For example, what is the necessary and sufficient condition on a pair (or more generally a bank )o f interpolation filters so that their outputs are jointly WSS (JWSS) for all jointly WSS inputs? What is the condition if only the sum of their outputs is required to be WSS? When is the output of an LPTV system (for example a uniform filter-bank) WSS for all WSS inputs? Some of these questions may appear to be simple general- izations of the above-mentioned result for a single interpolation filter. However, the frequency domain approaches that proved this result are quite difficult to generalize to answer these questions. The purpose of this paper is to provide these answers using analysis based on bifrequency maps and bispectra. These tools are two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier transforms that characterize all linear time-varying (LTV) systems and nonstationary random processes, respectively. We show that the questions raised above can be addressed elegantly and in a geometrically insightful way using these tools. We also derive a bifrequency characterization of lossless LTV systems. This may potentially lead to an increased understanding of these systems.","linear time-varying, multirate digital signal processing, bispectrum map, single interpolation filter, bifrequency characterization, interpolation filter, bifrequency map, LTV system, LTI filter, multirate systemswith stochastic input, above-mentioned result, WSS input, new look"
"This paper builds on consumer storytelling theory and childhood memory research by proposing that earliest childhood memory stories are useful for developing brand myths and providing relevance to iconic brands. This article investigates consumers' childhood memories with Coca-Cola and finds that memories from early childhood are more predictive and insightful for understanding current brand attitudes than memories coming from adolescence. A focus group is unable to elicit memories from as early in life as the childhood memory session. In addition, the memories elicited by the group interviewer are not as relevant and meaningful to participants. When participants read experiences coming from the childhood memory session, those who connect with the earliest childhood memory stories have the strongest attitudes toward Coca-Cola. A discussion describes how this research method aids in generating insights about iconic brands and brands aspiring to become iconic.","coca-cola, brand, myth, memory, childhood, icon, qualitative"
"The Zachman Framework offers a classification of the models created in an enterprise architecture project. These models form a holistic representation of the organization. Despite the prominent position of the Framework, there is little information publicly available to help designers create exact models that fit each other. In this paper, we propose a conceptualization based on General Systems Thinking. Our conceptualization provides concrete guidelines for creating the models required by the Framework. The proposed conceptualization establishes a better understanding of the models and of their relationships. This facilitates the creation and interpretation of the models. It also improves the traceability between them. We illustrate our approach with the results of a case study.","business data processing, information systems, software architecture, Zachman enterprise architecture, general systems thinking, information system architecture, systemic conceptualization, traceability, Business Process Modeling, Enterprise Architecture, Enterprise Modeling, IT Architecture, System Thinking, Zachman"
"Aicardi syndrome is a developmental disorder characterised by agenesis of the corpus callosum, retinal lacunae, seizures, and developmental delay. It is believed to be X linked with lethality in males. We report a set of monozygotic female twins one of whom is healthy and intellectually normal while the other has the classical Aicardi phenotype with profound retardation. Family history is negative. Both had normal karyotypes. Monozygosity was established by blood grouping, chromosomal heteromorphisms, and DNA analysis using six hypervariable probes (five autosomal and one X linked) and three X linked RFLP probes. We tested the hypothesis that preferential inactivation of a different X chromosome had occurred in each girl. Methylation sensitive RFLP analysis of DNA from EBV transformed B lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts using MspI/HpaII digestion and probing with M27 beta showed a very similar pattern of X inactivation in both twins with no evidence of preferential expression of one particular X chromosome. We conclude that the abnormalities in the affected twin are probably the consequence of a postzygotic mutation in early embryonic development.","x chromosome, genetic linkage, blood groups, dna analysis, karyotyping, family history, embryonic development"
"Cognitive radio (CR) networks have been developed to fully utilize spectrum resources. In the CR networks, imperfect sensing and selfish behavior of secondary users (SU) can significantly degrade the performance of primary users (PU). Game theory, which considers the game playersu0027 (PU/SU) selfish behavior, has been extensively investigated in the design of CR network. However, most related works focus on the network protocol design from the network perspective to improve video transmission system (i.e., PU) performance such as utility and throughput. However, a useru0027s satisfaction such as useru0027s quality of experience (QoE) has been largely neglected in existing works. In this paper, we propose to design a game user-oriented CR network for video applications, aiming to improve the QoE of users. In the proposed framework, the primary user games and the secondary user games are formulated as Stackelberg game. Specifically, a refunding term is defined in the useru0027s utility function to effectively consider and to reflect the QoE requirement of video streaming users. Our contributions include two folds: (1) A game based CR network design for video transmission is proposed, and the network useru0027s QoE requirement is satisfied in the design; (2) The existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg gameu0027s Nash equilibrium is proved, and the design is optimal. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the game-based user-oriented CR network design.","cognitive radio (CR), nash equilibrium (NE), primary user (PU), quality of experience (QoE), secondary user (SU), stackelberg game"
"Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) and its most significant complication, macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), have traditionally been treated with steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications. However, the introduction of biologic medications that inhibit specific cytokines, such interleukins 1 and 6, has changed the treatment paradigm for sJIA patients. In this review, we discuss the therapies currently used in the treatment of sJIA as well as novel targets and approaches under consideration, including mesenchymal stromal cell therapy and JAK inhibitors. We also discuss targeting cytokines that have been implicated in MAS, such as interferon gamma and interleukin 18.","MAS, macrophage activation syndrome, sJIA, sJIA treatment, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis"
"Different forms of parallelism have been extensively investigated over the last few years in logic programs and a number of systems have been proposed. Or/And System (OASys) is an experimental parallel Prolog system that exploits and-or-parallelism and comprises a computational model, a compiler, an abstract machine and an emulator. OASys computational model combines the two types of parallelism considering each alternative path as a totally independent computation which consists of a conjunction of determinate subgoals. It is based on distributed scheduling and supports recomputation of paths as well as stack copying. The system features modular design, high distribution and minimal inter-processor communication. This paper presents briefly the computational model and describes the abstract machine discussing data representation, memory organization, instruction set, operation and synchronization. Finally performance results obtained by the single-processor implementation and the multiple-processor emulation are discussed.","oasys computational model, recomputation, and-or-parallelism, prolog, abstract architecture, abstract machine, stack copying, and-or parallelism, modular design, data representation, computer model"
"The use of bracing in the treatment of mild idiopathic scoliosis is controversial. A study of 33 adolescents showed that bracing significantly decreased lung volumes. Functional residual capacity was reduced by a mean of 26%, 18% of children showing a reduction of greater than 40%. The mean reduction in total lung capacity was 16% and in forced vital capacity 18%. This restriction of lung function by bracing might have a deleterious effect on lung growth or might impose an additional risk factor in the presence of other disorders, such as asthma and diaphragmatic weakness. The use of bracing in individuals with mild scoliosis should be judiciously reassessed.","total lung capacity, forced vital capacity, risk factors, functional residual capacity"
"40 college students were selected as high and 40 as low in anxiety (IPAT Anxiety Scale). Ss judged the horizontal plane while viewing a specially designed room (Leaf Room) through aniseikonic lenses. Groups of Ss were subdivided and provided either task or threat orientation to the perceptual procedure. High-anxious in comparison with low-anxious Ss required more time to recognize the perceptual distortion produced by aniseikonic lenses, and they estimated a smaller degree of distortion. Thus high anxiety appeared to retard ability to shift from familiar to unfamiliar but veridical percepts. The effects of ego threat were less clear but seemed to relate to certain inverse reaction tendencies present among high anxious Ss.

"We present a novel estimator for map construction in the presence of segregation distortion which is highly computationally efficient. For multi-parental designs this estimator outperforms methods that do not account for segregation distortion, at no extra computational cost. Inclusion of genetic markers exhibiting segregation distortion in a linkage map can result in biased estimates of genetic distance and distortion of map positions. Removal of distorted markers is hence a typical filtering criterion; however, this may result in exclusion of biologically interesting regions of the genome such as introgressions and translocations. Estimation of additional parameters characterizing the distortion is computationally slow, as it relies on estimation via the Expectation Maximization algorithm or a higher dimensional numerical optimisation. We propose a robust M-estimator (RM) capable of handling tens of thousands of distorted markers from a single linkage group. We show via simulation that for multi-parental designs the RM estimator can perform much better than uncorrected estimation, at no extra computational cost. We then apply the RM estimator to chromosome 2B in wheat in a multi-parent population segregating for the Sr36 introgression, a known transmission distorter. The resulting map contains over 700 markers, and is consistent with maps constructed from crosses which do not exhibit segregation distortion.","Segregation Distortion, Recombination Fraction, Distorted Marker, Biallelic Marker, Extra Computational Cost"
"To enhance the rapid response ability of manufacturing system, the machine tools' modular design oriented to reconfiguration was analyzed. Then the general idea of machine tools' reconfiguration oriented to process-capability was presented. The machine tools' reconfiguration arithmetic based on modularization was researched mostly in such aspects as ability similarity account, relativity analysis, module reconfiguration of lacking ability parameter, module reconfiguration of redundancy ability parameter, ability comparing, module displacing and ability checking up. The arithmetic was validated by the configuration and reconfiguration of machining center, which indicates the arithmetic is feasible and effective.","Arithmetic, Manufacturing equipment, Module, Process capability, Reconfiguration"
"Human RT112 cells were exposed to single doses of X-rays (0.05-5 Gy), and cell survival was measured using a Dynamic Microscopic Imaging Processing Scanner (DMIPS) with which individual cells can be located in tissue-culture flasks, their positions recorded, and after an appropriate incubation time the recorded positions revisited to allow the accurate scoring of survivors. The response over the X-ray dose range 1-5 Gy showed a good fit to a Linear-Quadratic (LQ) model. For X-ray doses < 1 Gy, an increased effect of X-rays was observed with cell survival below the prediction from the LQ model extrapolated from higher doses. Several arguments suggest that this phenomenon could reflect an induced radioresistance so that in this cell line, low single doses of X-rays are more effective per Gray than higher doses in reducing cell survival because only at higher doses, above a threshold, is there sufficient damage to trigger radioprotective mechanisms.","hypersensitivity-induced radioresistance, low doses (<1 gy), human tumour cell line, radiation dose, cell line"
"It has been noted that reduced-size liver transplants are associated with increased rates of biliary complications, and it has been suggested that some of these complications can be handled nonoperatively. In a 6-year period, 91 orthotopic liver transplants were performed in 77 children. The medical records were reviewed to analyze the effect of reduced-size grafts on the incidence of bile duct complications and to investigate the utility of interventional radiology techniques for treatment. Forty-two children received 47 whole-organ transplants, and 35 children received 44 reduced-size transplants. The median age and weight were greater for children receiving whole-organ transplants (age, 4.25 years; weight, 16 kg) than for those receiving reduced-size grafts (age, 1.0 year; weight, 8 kg). The overall incidence of bile duct complications was 19.5% (n = 15). The incidence was not different between the whole organ group (17%) and the reduced-size group (16%). Four of the children with bile duct complications had associated hepatic artery thrombosis, two of whom had another transplant. Complications included anastomotic stricture (n = 6), anastomotic leak (n = 5), intraparenchymal biloma (n = 3), and multiple strictures (n = 1). Twelve of 15 children presented within 3 months of transplantation. Six children had initial percutaneous drainage or placement of transanastomotic stents (external). Operative repair was eventually required for all 15 children, three of whom received a second transplant. There was a 40% incidence of cytomegalovirus infection involving the liver or extrahepatic bile ducts near the time of presentation. There were two deaths among the 15 children; only one was a direct result of the bile duct complication. Neither the rate nor type of bile duct complication differs between the whole-organ and the reduced-size group. Nonoperative therapy was uniformly unsuccessful. Percutaneous approaches allowed for clinical improvement before operative intervention.","biliary complications, pediatric, liver transplantation, spectrum"
"Detection of intestinal ischemia, prior to necrosis, is a major clinical problem. The lysosomal acid hydrolase, hexosaminidase (HEX), is known to be elevated in intestinal infarction. To determine if this enzyme could differentiate between partial intestinal ischemia and full-thickness intestinal gangrene, the following rat study was designed. Partial segmental intestinal ischemia was created by ligating alternate vascular bundles over a short (6 vessel) segment of the small-bowel mesentery, and complete segmental intestinal vascular occlusion was achieved by ligating the blood supply to the ileocecal segment. Preoperative serum HEX values were obtained from 15 animals. The rats were separated into one sham-operated and two intestinal ischemia groups. At four hours after surgery HEX values were determined. Total HEX activity was significantly elevated four hours after insult in both partial and complete intestinal ischemia, (P less than 0.005 and P less than 0.001 respectively). Total HEX activity was greater in complete intestinal ischemia than in partial ischemia, (P less than 0.05). Three neonates with intestinal perforation, secondary to necrotizing enterocolitis, were evaluated. The mean preoperative HEX activity was 1421 nmol/hr/mL serum and the mean post-resection HEX activity was 808 nmol/hr/mL serum. These data suggest that serum HEX activity may be a good marker for intestinal gangrene in neonates with necrotizing enterocolitis.","necrotizing enterocolitis, intestinal gangrene, mesenteric infarction, hexosaminidase"
"Acute appendicitis is the most common emergency presenting to pediatric surgeons. With proper history and thorough physical examination, the diagnosis of the condition clinically should approach 90%. With the increasing ease of performing radiologic investigations because of technological advances, more ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) are used to help diagnosing appendicitis. The aim of this study is to review the trend of diagnosing appendicitis in a single center and discuss the implications.A retrospective analysis was carried out for all patients who were admitted with acute appendicitis between 1997 and 2007. The methods of diagnosis were divided into 3 groups as follows: clinical, ultrasound, and CT. The demographics and operative findings were noted. Statistical analysis was done using Fisher's Exact test and paired t test when appropriate. A value of P < .05 was considered to be statistically significant.During this period, a total of 254 patients (167 boys and 87 girls) were admitted with appendicitis. The average age at presentation was 12 years, and the mean duration of symptoms before presentation was 2 days. For 11 years, there was an initial rise of the use of ultrasound (10% in 1997 to a peak of 60% in 2005). This percentage decreased with a corresponding rise of the use of CT scan (0% in 1997 to 35% in 2007). There was no correlation found between the use of adjunct investigations and the severity of appendicitis found at operation, suggesting an overreliance of CT.It appears that there is an increasing trend in using radiologic investigations for the diagnosis of appendicitis for the past 11 years. With the association of cancer in later life and early radiation exposure well documented, it would be advisable to avoid the use of CT if possible.","computer tomography, diagnosis, appendicitis, physical examination, ultrasound, computed tomography"

"The present study examined cognitive functioning in a population sample of adolescents with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986.The sample consisted of 457 adolescents ages 16 to 18 who were assessed using a battery of cognitive tasks. Performance according to diagnostic group (control, behavior disorder, and ADHD) and sex was compared. Then, the effect of executive function deficit (EFD) was assessed by diagnostic group status on behavioral and cognitive measures.When compared to non-ADHD groups, adolescents with ADHD exhibited deficits on almost all of the cognitive measures. The behavior disorder group obtained scores that were generally intermediate between the ADHD and control groups, but exhibited deficits in intelligence and executive function similar to the ADHD group. Approximately half the ADHD sample had EFD; however, the type and presence of EFDs were not differentially related to cognitive performance as a function of diagnosis.These findings indicate that EFDs are more frequent in ADHD than control or behavior disorder groups. EFDs are a general risk factor for poor cognitive functioning across multiple domains, irrespective of diagnostic status.","neuropsychological, working memory, inhibition, impairment, executive function, cognitive processes, cognitive function"
"Shoeprints are frequently acquired at crime scenes and can provide vital clues for investigation. How to retrieve the most similar shoeprints available in the dataset to the highly degraded query crime scene shoeprint is a challenging work. Some existing shoeprint retrieval algorithms cannot work well with highly degraded shoeprint image on a large scale dataset, and the results are not well correlated with the forensic experts. This study proposes a manifold ranking based method using hybrid features of region and appearance to improve the retrieval performance. Manifold ranking method is introduced to narrow the well-known gap between visual features and semantic concepts. We define the ranking cost function from three perspectives: (i) the feature similarity between the query and the dataset images, (ii) the relationship between every two shoeprints in the dataset, (iii) the assigned opinion scores for multiple shoeprints left in one crime scene by the forensic expert. Experiments on the real crime scene datasets show that the cumulative match score of the proposed method is more than 93.5 % on the top 2 % of the dataset composed of 10096 crime scene shoeprints.","Crime scene shoeprint, Manifold ranking, Shoeprint retrieval, Hybrid features"
"This study proposes and tests an integrative model to examine the relations among service quality, value, image, satisfaction, and loyalty in China. Analysis of survey data from 118 customers of a Chinese mobile communications company reveals that service quality directly influences both perceived value and image perceptions, that value and image influence satisfaction, that corporate image influences value, and that both customer satisfaction and value are significant determinants of loyalty. Thus, value has both a direct and indirect (through satisfaction) impact on customer loyalty. Other variables mediate the impact of both service quality and corporate image on customer loyalty.","value, satisfaction, image, mobile communications, china, loyalty, customer loyalty, customer satisfaction, service quality, survey data, mobile communication"
There is relatively little published literature concerning utilization management in anatomic pathology. Nonetheless there are many utilization management opportunities that currently exist and are well recognized. Some of these impact only the cost structure within the pathology department itself whereas others reduce charges for third party payers. Utilization management may result in medical legal liabilities for breaching the standard of care. For this reason it will be important for pathology professional societies to develop national utilization guidelines to assist individual practices in implementing a medically sound approach to utilization management.,"anatomic pathology, reimbursement, surgical pathology, utilization management"
"The biological activity of Ras proteins is thought to be controlled by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor and the guanosine triphosphatase activating protein (GAP). Treatment of rat pheochromocytoma PC-12 cells with nerve growth factor (NGF) increased the amount of active Ras guanosine triphosphate complex and stimulated the activities of both the guanine nucleotide exchange factor and GAP. In PC-12 cells that overexpressed the tyrosine kinase encoded by the trk proto-oncogene (a component of the high-affinity NGF receptor), the NGF-induced activation of the regulatory proteins was potentiated. These results suggest that the NGF receptor system enhances the activities of both the guanine nucleotide exchange factor and GAP and that the activation of Ras might be controlled by the balance in activity between these two regulatory proteins.","guanine nucleotide exchange factor, activator protein, tyrosine kinase, biological activity"
"The corrugated steel plate is a widely used structural element in many fields of application because of its favourable properties and has been applied since the 1920s. For the last 20 years it has been increasingly used in the web of steel and composite bridges. When such a bridge is incrementally launched, buckling of the thin steel web may occur. In this paper, a numerical model is developed on the basis of previous experiments. Numerical investigations are made for the determination of the patch loading resistance, and the geometric parameters which influence the patch loading resistance and the structural behaviour are determined and analysed. Existing design formulas from the literature are summarised from the point of view of bridges, and enhanced according to the numerical results and the existing and additional experiments.","Patch loading, Web crippling, Corrugated web, Composite bridge, Steel bridge"
"The Variational Bayesian learning, proposed as an approximation of the Bayesian learning, has provided computational tractability and good generalization performance in many applications. However, little has been done to investigate its theoretical properties. In this paper, we discuss the Variational Bayesian learning of the mixture of exponential families and derive the asymptotic form of the stochastic complexities in a generalized setting of the prior distribution. We show that the stochastic complexities become smaller than those of regular statistical models, which implies that the advantage of the Bayesian learning still remains in the Variational Bayesian learning. Stochastic complexity, which is called the marginal likelihood or the free energy, not only becomes important in addressing the model selection problem but also enables us to discuss the accuracy of the Variational Bayesian approach as an approximation of the true Bayesian learning. The main result also shows the effects of the prior distribution under the generalized setting.","Bayesian learning, Variational Bayes, stochastic complexity, Exponential family, computational tractability, Variational Bayesian, Non-regular model, true Bayesian learning, exponential family, prior distribution, Variational Bayesian approach, Free energy, generalized setting, Kullback information, Generalized Bayes, generalized variational Bayes, Variational Bayesian learning, Mixture model, asymptotic form, Stochastic complexity"
"As a central construct in theories of ethical decision making, ethical judgments have been the subject of more than one hundred empirical studies. Despite its size, the ethical judgments literature seems to lack clarity in three areas. First, empirical results are sometimes inconsistent or contradictory across studies. Second, a broad array of diverse measures of ethical judgments raises concerns about research validity. Third, differences in sample composition may affect comparability of study results. To help resolve these issues, this study conducts a review and meta-analysis of the ethical judgments literature. The results offer insights in all three areas. They help resolve some of the inconsistencies in the relationships between ethical judgments and certain theoretical antecedents; they support the use of diverse measures of ethical judgments; and they offer caution in the use of student samples in ethical judgments research.","ethical judgments, ethics, meta-analysis, review, meta analysis"
"The modeling, analysis and design of systems is generally based on many formalisms to describe discrete and/or continuous behaviors, and to map these descriptions into a specific platform. In this context, the article proposes the concept of functional metamodeling to capture, then to integrate modeling languages. The concept offers an alternative to standard Model Driven Engineering (MDE) and is well adapted to mathematical descriptions such as the ones found in system modeling. As an application, a set of functional metamodels is proposed for dataflows (usable to model continuous behaviors), state-transition systems (usable to model discrete behaviors) and a metamodel for actions (to model interactions with a target platform and concurrent execution). A model of a control architecture for a legged robot is proposed as an application of these modeling languages.","system modeling, target platform, continuous behavior, specific platform, functional metamodeling, model interaction, model driven engineering (mde), discrete behavior, modeling language, concurrent execution, functional metamodels, model driven engineering, standard model"
"The Asian snake Rhabdophis tigrinus possesses specialized defensive glands on its neck that contain steroidal toxins known as bufadienolides. We hypothesized that R. tigrinus does not synthesize these defensive steroids but instead sequesters the toxins from toads it consumes as prey. To test this hypothesis, we conducted chemical analyses on the glandular fluid from snakes collected in toad-free and toad-present localities. We also performed feeding experiments in which hatchling R. tigrinus were reared on controlled diets that either included or lacked toads. We demonstrate that the cardiotonic steroids in the nuchal glands of R. tigrinus are obtained from dietary toads. We further show that mothers containing high levels of bufadienolides can provision their offspring with toxins. Hatchlings had bufadienolides in their nuchal glands only if they were fed toads or were born to a dam with high concentrations of these compounds. Because geographic patterns in the availability of toxic prey are reflected in the chemical composition of the glandular fluid, snakes in toad-free regions are left undefended by steroidal toxins. Our findings confirm that the sequestration of dietary toxins underlies geographic variation in antipredatory behavior in this species and provide a unique example of sequestered defensive compounds in a specialized vertebrate structure.","food chain, snakes, chemical composition, chemical defense"
"Recent data (T. J. Perfect, C. J. A. Moulin, M. A. Conway, & E. Perry, 2002) have suggested that retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF) depends on conceptual memory because the effect is not found in perceptually driven tasks. In 3 experiments, the authors aimed to show that the presence of RIF depends on whether the procedure induces appropriate transfer between representations and competition rather than on the nature of the final test. The authors adapted the standard paradigm to introduce lexical categories (words that shared the first 2 letters) at study and practice. Direct and indirect fragment completion tests were used at retrieval. The results showed significant RIF effects in perceptually driven tasks. Furthermore, they indicated that the presence of RIF effects depended on using adequate cuing to induce competition during the retrieval practice and on the final memory test tapping the inhibited representation.","experimental psychology, psycholinguistics, task analysis, memory, testing, word order, competition"
"As a result of a world-wide intensive research activity, a new design concept for structural moment resistant joints has been suggested and implemented in design codes. In the present paper, its background is first briefly described and the main contributions to its development are presented. As a matter of fact, because of the high number of past and ongoing researches, reports and papers devoted to this topic, an exhaustive list of all these works could not be established in a limited number of pages. The possibilities of extension of the new design concepts, which have been first developed for steel beam-to-column joints under static loading, are particularly pointed out. This aspect appears quite important as in the near future it should provide designers with a unified design approach for structural joints whatever their loading, their configurations and the nature of their constitutive material(s).","numerical model, structural joints, economy, fitting, characterisation, analytical model, experimentation, building frames, classification, fire, idealisation, earthquake, static loading, mechanical model, practical design tool, modelling"
"This paper presents the results of some observations on the selection and performance of junior officers in the Marine Corps. Major results are based on 100 cases. Sociometric group opinion was a more valid predictor both of success in Officer Candidate School and of combat performance than several objectivet ests (intelligence, two personal inventories, and Army Mechanical Aptitude Test). Reasons for the relative superiority of group opinion are discussed.

"The elastic method previously developed for the design of steel structures subject to a fire for a 2-dimensional framework has been extended to a 3-dimensional one. In the method for a 2-dimensional framework, only bending about the major axis is a primary condition for design consideration. In this context, the deterioration of the bending moment capacity of a steel member subject to increasing temperature is related to the elastic bending moments attained due to the actions of both the static loading and the thermal loading. The relationship can be established for each member in terms of the unknown limiting temperature which can be solved. The lowest of the limiting temperatures of all members is the critical one for the whole structure. In extending this design method to a 3-dimensional framework, failure criteria beyond pure bending are used to appropriately reflect the state of force interactions in the members. This approach is reasonable as, in reality, structural members in a 3-dimensional framework are subject to different forces attributable to their ultimate failure at increasing temperature. In this paper, axial-bending interaction, including bending about both axes, is adopted as the failure criteria although other failure criteria, if required, can easily be incorporated into the design. In the examples given, it is shown that the limiting temperature of the structure decreases as the complexity of the failure criteria increases.","space frames, limiting temperature, force interaction, steel, fire engineering, elastic analysis, 3 dimensional, design method, 2 dimensional"
"The desire to achieve synergy via shared resources is a primary motivation for many mergers, acquisitions and alliances. However, all too often the benefits of synergy are never realized. Using the results of empirical studies from a wide range of manufacturing and service industries, the authors develop a series of checks which can be used to determine whether there is potential for synergy from shared resources; whether that potential is realized and whether the synergy will lead to a sustained competitive advantage.","service industry, sustainable competitive advantage, empirical study, competitive advantage"
"In our continuing investigation of the significance of leukocytosis in prostatic fluid (PF), the relation of leukocytosis in PF to that in selected sections of prostate with significant inflammation was studies with whole-mount specimens obtained at radical prostatectomy from 12 patients with prostate cancer. Although leukocytosis was observed both in PF and in prostate tissue in all 12 patients, there was no correlation between the leukocyte count in PF and the intensity of inflammation. However, the ratio of macrophages among leukocytes in PF correlated with the number of ducts filled with macrophages in prostate tissue (p=0.0481). This finding was consistent with our previous finding that activation of macrophages in PF reflects active inflammation in prostate tissue. Further studies are needed to clarify the roles of macrophages and whole leukocytes in PF and prostate tissue.","prostatitis, leukocytes, macrophages, prostatic fluid, inflammation"
"National Taiwan University College of Medicine (NTUCM) introduced small groups of teaching and basic-clinical integrated courses for medical students in 1992. By using computer network and multimedia techniques, this study tried to overcome barriers to learning in small group teaching. The Department of Medical Informatics of NTUCM established campus networking and computer classrooms and provided Internet and intranet network services including mail, netnews, bulletin board systems (BBS), world wide web (WWW), gopher, ftp and local file servers. To implement an interactive learning environment, the authors first tried mail lists, newsgroups and BBS. Next an integrated learning system prototype on the WWW was developed to provide functions including online syllabus, discussion boards simulated to BBS, online talk, interactive case studies, virtual classroom with video on demand (VOD) and Internet medical resources. The results showed that after the medical students completed the required course of medical informatics and had good network access using a network to communicate with each other became a daily practice. In the future, the system will extend to the tutoring of clinical practice and continuing medical education. The authors expect a national medical education network and more international cooperation and exchange.","computer assisted learning medical informatics, medical education, small group teaching, bulletin board system, world wide web, computer network"
"The behavior of concrete-filled steel square hollow section (SHS) and rectangular hollow section (RHS) columns with or without fire protection subjected to axial or eccentric loads has been experimentally investigated and the results are presented in this paper. The parametric and experimental studies provide information for the development of formulas for the calculation of the fire resistance and the fire protection thickness of the composite columns. The main objectives of this paper were threefold: first, to report a series of fire tests on composite columns with square and rectangular sections. Secondly, to analyze the influence of several parameters, such as fire duration time, sectional dimension, slenderness ratio, load eccentricity ratio, strength of steel and concrete on the residual strength index (RSI) of the composite columns. Finally, to develop formulas for the calculation of the fire resistance and the fire protection thickness of the concrete-filled steel SHS and RHS columns, such formulas to be suitable for incorporation into building codes. The concepts of this paper were used to provide data on the necessary fire protection measures for the concrete-filled steel SHS columns used in a high-rise building, Ruifeng, Shangye Building in Hangzhou City, in southern China.","concrete-filled steel shs or rhs, composite columns, hollow sections, fire resistance, fire protection, concrete, design, temperature, columns, china"
"In this era of evolving health care systems throughout the world, technology remains the substance of health care. Medical informatics comprises a growing contribution to the technologies used in the delivery and management of health care. Diverse, evolving technologies include artificial neural networks, computer-assisted surgery, computer-based patient records, hospital information systems, and more. Decision-makers increasingly demand well-founded information to determine whether or how to develop these technologies, allow them on the market, acquire them, use them, pay for their use, and more. The development and wider use of health technology assessment (HTA) reflects this demand. While HTA offers systematic, well-founded approaches for determining the value of medical informatics technologies, HTA must continue to adapt and refine its methods in response to these evolving technologies. This paper provides a basic overview of HTA principles and methods.","artificial neural network, health care, randomized controlled trial, decision maker"
"Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a recent technology, which aims at replacing traditional methods of remote communications, such as RPC-based Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM). Being designed with a goal of increasing interoperability among wide range of programs and environment, SOAP allows applications written in different languages and deployed on different platforms to communicate with each other over the network. While SOAP offers obvious benefits in the world of interoperability, it comes at a price of performance degradation and additional development efforts required for implementation of features missing from SOAP, such as security and state management. This paper reports the outcome of a comparative study of SOAP and DCOM in terms of features, development effort, and application performance. The results indicate that SOAP performance on a homogeneous platform is consistently worse than that of DCOM. Depending on the operation and the amount of data transferred, SOAP performance degradation can range from minor (e.g. two or three times slower than DCOM) to major (e.g. twenty or more times slower).","simple object access protocol, soap performance, performance degradation, component object model, soap, dcom, application performance, additional development effort, development effort, performance analysis, different platform, comparative study, different language, soap performance degradation, distributed computing, distributed component object model, data transfer"
"With increasing primary productivity, ciliates may become the most important members of the microbial loop and form a central linkage in the transformation of microbial production to upper trophic levels. How metazooplankters, especially copepods, regulate ciliate community structure in shallow eutrophic waters is not completely clear. We carried out mesocosm experiments with different cyclopoid copepod enrichments in a shallow eutrophic lake to examine the responses of ciliate community structure and abundance to changes in cyclopoid copepod biomass and to detect any cascading effects on bacterioplankton and edible phytoplankton. Our results indicate that an increase in copepod zooplankton biomass favours the development of small-sized bacterivorous ciliates. This effect is unleashed by the decline of predaceous ciliate abundance, which would otherwise graze effectively on the small-sized ciliates. The inverse relationship between crustacean zooplankton and large predaceous ciliates is an important feature adjusting not only the structure of the ciliate community but also the energy transfer between meta- and protozooplankton. Still we could not detect any cascading effects on bacterio- or phytoplankton that would be caused by the structural changes in the ciliate community.","Ciliates, Eutrophic lakes, Metazooplankton, Microbial loop, Predation, Trophic interactions"
"Thirty-five children, aged 4 to 13 (X = 9.54), meeting strict DSM-III criteria for schizophrenia, are described. The subjects were diagnosed using a new semistructured interview. All were in the normal range of intelligence (mean IQ = 94) and free of neurological disorders. Characteristic auditory hallucinations were present in 80% and delusions in 63% of the sample. The mean age of onset of psychotic symptoms was 6.9 years. Premorbid histories of attention deficit, conduct disturbance and/or developmental abnormalities were common. The nature and content of psychotic symptoms varied with developmental stage. The phenomenological presentation of the sample was similar to previous studies of young schizophrenic children.","schizophrenia, hallucination, structured interviews, delusion"
"Researchers have acknowledged that flow is a useful construct for explaining consumer behavior in the context of computer-mediated environments. However, the issue of how flow can actually facilitate particular Internet shopping behaviors has not been adequately investigated. This article will explore conditions under which different dimensions of flow facilitate different aspects of Internet shopping behaviors (browsing, one-time purchases, and repeat purchases) and how this relationship is moderated by consumer-related factors (perceived risk, willingness to buy, consumer self-confidence), the nature of the product (goods vs. service), and the nature of the purchase occasion (planned vs. impulse). We offer managerial implications and future research directions resulting from our research.","flow, shopping behavior, internet, consumer behavior, perceived risk"
"This paper proposes a novel nature-inspired algorithm called Multi-Verse Optimizer (MVO). The main inspirations of this algorithm are based on three concepts in cosmology: white hole, black hole, and wormhole. The mathematical models of these three concepts are developed to perform exploration, exploitation, and local search, respectively. The MVO algorithm is first benchmarked on 19 challenging test problems. It is then applied to five real engineering problems to further confirm its performance. To validate the results, MVO is compared with four well-known algorithms: Grey Wolf Optimizer, Particle Swarm Optimization, Genetic Algorithm, and Gravitational Search Algorithm. The results prove that the proposed algorithm is able to provide very competitive results and outperforms the best algorithms in the literature on the majority of the test beds. The results of the real case studies also demonstrate the potential of MVO in solving real problems with unknown search spaces. Note that the source codes of the proposed MVO algorithm are publicly available at http://www.alimirjalili.com/MVO.html.","Optimization, Meta-heuristic, Algorithm, Benchmark, Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Heuristic"
"The atomic structure of reconstructed Si(001)c(4 x 4)-C surface has been studied by coaxial impact collision ion scattering spectroscopy. When the 100L of ethylene (C(2)H(4)) molecules have been exposed on Si(001)-(2 x 1) surface at 700 degrees C, it is found that C atoms cause the ordering of missing Si dimer defects and occupy the fourth layer of Si(001) directly below the bridge site. Our results provide the support for the previous model in which a missing dimer structure is accompanied by C incorporation into the subsurface.","structure analysis, ion beam, atomic structure, surface reconstruction"
"The aim of this study was to revise the factors influencing the service life of galvanic coupling between carbon steel and stainless steel reinforcements in simulated concrete pore solution, simulating the condition of a damaged structure repaired with stainless steel reinforcing bars. Numerous investigations have reported that austenitic stainless steel rebar, compared to carbon steel, when embedded in concrete, offer superior corrosion resistance in aggressive environments, especially chloride contaminated concrete. In concrete, contact with other metals should be avoided because of the risk of galvanic corrosion. When passive, both carbon steel and stainless steel have comparable corrosion potentials and the coupling of the two materials is of little effect on the corrosion behavior of either material. Galvanic current values measured between carbon and stainless steel are negligible.","stainless steel, carbon steel, galvanic coupling, corrosion potential, galvanic corrosion, carbon steel corrosion potential galvanic corrosion galvanic coupling reinforcing bar stainless steel, reinforcing bar, corrosion resistance, service life"
"Recent marketing literature pays particular attention to customer value because of the potential impact on customer behavior and, ultimately, firm performance. Whereas some studies conceptualize customer value in a unidimensional manner, more recent approaches take a multidimensional approach, generally conceptualizing value as composed of various benefits and sacrifices. However, nearly all of these studies consider value components in a reflective manner, which is not only problematic but in many cases conceptually incorrect. In addition, recent customer value research includes service components to define and operationalize the construct. This study suggests that customer value in service contexts, or service value , represents a higher-order, formative construct with benefit and sacrifice components. Specifically, the authors propose a formative model of service value with four components: service quality, service equity, confidence benefits, and perceived sacrifice. A multiple-industry study substantiates the contention that this higher-order, formative approach best models value. The results theoretically and empirically support the conceptualization of service value with formative components, and the measure is robust and works well across multiple service contexts.","formative measurement, services, service value, customer value, higher order, customer behavior, service quality"
"Monkeys are able to increase or decrease triceps surae H-reflex when reward depends on reflex amplitude. Operantly conditioned change occurs over weeks and produces persistent alterations in the lumbosacral spinal cord which should be technically accessible substrates of primate memory. Previous work monitored and conditioned triceps surae H-reflex in one leg. To determine whether H-reflex conditioning in one leg affects the control leg, the present study monitored H-reflexes in both legs while the reflex in one leg underwent HR increases or HR decreases conditioning. Under the HR increases mode, H-reflex increase was much greater in the HR increases leg than in the control leg. Under the HR decreases mode, H-reflex decrease was confined to the HR decreases leg. By showing that conditioning of one leg's H-reflex produces H-reflex asymmetry, the data further define the phenomenon and indicate that the other leg can serve as an internal control for physiologic and anatomic studies exploring the sites and mechanisms of the spinal cord memory substrates.","Memory, Learning, Operant conditioning, Plasticity, Spinal cord, Spinal reflex, Monosynaptic reflex"
"Customer accounting focuses on the financial measurement of customers. This article develops a framework to explain a company's choice of customer accounting technique based on its customer resource interfaces. Four different customer relationships each with its own customer accounting techniques have been identified and are reported here. Transactional customer relationships with low technical and organizational interfaces are associated with customer segment profitability analysis. Facilitative customer relationships with low technical and high organizational interfaces are associated with customer profitability analysis. Integrative customer relationships with high technical and organizational interfaces are associated with life time profitability analysis. Connective customer relationships with high technical and low organizational interfaces are associated with customer valuation analysis. Explorative case studies in the telecom company Ericsson and the paper company Holmen informs the framework. The case data support the framework developed. However, the empirical results are not without ambiguity. The case studies give a more complex picture of how customer accounting techniques are related to a firm's inter-organizational interfaces.","customer accounting, interfaces, customer profitability, customer measurement, relationships, resources, profitability"
"Due to the dramatic price increase of precious metals, the replacement of Au with Cu in wire bonding has become an emerging trend for IC packaging nowadays. Similar to the Pb-free soldering transition, such a replacement is not just a simple drop-in material change. Comprehensive processing and reliability investigations are required before a mass production of electronic devices with Cu wire bonding can be implemented. However, among the existing studies on Cu wire bonding, it appears that most researchers just focused on issues above the wire bond pads. In fact, the Cu in the wire bonds may diffuse into the Si chip and impose reliability threats to the electronic devices. So far there was no research on the Cu-to-Si diffusion issue in Cu wire bonding. In this paper, an experimental study on the Cu-to-Si diffusion in Cu wire bond is reported. The Cu diffusion depth was characterized with the secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) technique. Specimens with various configurations were designed and fabricated to investigate the effects of several parameters on the Cu-to-Si diffusion depth. The issues of concern include the amount of Cu supply, the bond pad deformation, and the barrier layer under the bond pad. In addition, some samples with conventional Au wire bonding were fabricated and tested in parallel for comparison.","secondary ion mass spectrometry, mass production, chip, copper"
"Astrocytes play a key role for maintenance of brain water homeostasis, but little is known about mechanisms of short-term regulation of astrocyte water permeability. Here, we report that glutamate increases astrocyte water permeability and that the molecular target for this effect is the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) serine 111 residue, which is in a strategic position for control of the water channel gating. The glutamate effect involves activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), intracellular calcium release, and activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). The physiological impact of our results is underlined by the finding that mGluR activation increases the rate of hypoosmotic tissue swelling in acute rat hippocampal slices. Cerebral ischemia is associated with an excessive release of glutamate, and in postischemic cerebral edema ablation of AQP4 attenuates the degree of damage. Thus, we have identified AQP4 as the molecular target for drugs that may attenuate the development of brain edema.","glutamate, cell biology, aquaporin, neurosciences, metabotropic glutamate receptors"
"A comprehensive research program on large-size, welded moment connections conducted after the 1994 Northridge earthquake in California has identified three critical issues that could significantly affect the strength and ductility of the connections. They are: fracture toughness of weld metal, geometry and size of weld access hole, and control of panel zone deformation. Experimental and analytical studies on each of the issues have been performed at the Center for Advanced Technology for Large Structural Systems at Lehigh University.

"This paper presents a finite element analysis of the first Cardington test using shell elements to model the concrete floor slab. The behaviour of these elements is defined using FEAST, a program that allows the behaviour of the shell elements to be defined within the commercial finite element package ABAQUS, using stress-resultants. The model of the test is described and the assumptions that were made are noted and justified. The results of the analysis indicate that the response of the structure is overwhelmingly dominated by the effects of thermal expansion and that material degradation and gravity loading are of secondary importance. It is noted that as a consequence of the rectangular nature of the fire compartment, tensile membrane action occurs from the beginning of the test.","composite slabs in fire, finite element modelling, resrained beam test, restrained thermal expansion, thermal expansion, preprint, finite element, finite element analysis, structure analysis"
"In this paper we operationally define and measure tacit knowledge at the team-level in the software development domain. Through a series of three empirical studies we developed and validated the team tacit knowledge measure (TTKM) for software developers. In the first study, initial scale items were developed using the repertory grid technique and content analysis. In Study 2, supplied repertory grids were administered to novices and experts to establish differential items, and Study 3 validated the TTKM on a sample of 48 industrial software development teams. In developing the TTKM we explored the relationships between tacit knowledge, explicit job knowledge and social interaction and their effect on team performance as measured by efficiency and effectiveness. In addition we assess the implications for managing software development teams and increasing team performance through social interaction.","repertory grid, explicit job knowledge, software development domain, agile methods, tacit knowledge, team performance, social interaction, software developer, knowledge, team management, industrial software development team, software development team, team tacit knowledge measure, team tacit knowledge, team measure, knowledge management, software engineering, content analysis, empirical study, information technology, software development"
"Spermatocyte spreading and immunostaining were applied to detect meiotic prophase I progression, homologous chromosome pairing, synapsis and recombination in an azoospermic reciprocal translocation 46, XY, t(5;7;9;13)(5q11;7p11;7p15;9q12;13p12) carrier. Histological examination of the haematoxylin and eosin stained testicular sections revealed reduced germ cells with no spermatids or sperm in the patient. TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase)-mediated dUDP nick-end labelling assay showed apoptotic cells in testicular sections of translocation carrier. Immnunofluorescence analysis indicated the presence of an octavalent in all the pachytene spermatocytes analysed in the patient. Meiotic progression was disturbed, as an increase in zygotene (P < 0.001) and decrease in the pachytene spermatocytes (P < 0.001) were observed in the t(5;7;9;13) carrier compared with controls. It was further observed that 93% of octavalents were found partially asynapsed between homologous chromosomes. A significant decrease in the recombination frequency was observed on 5p, 5q, 7q, 9p and 13q in the translocation carrier compared with the reported controls. A significant reduction in XY recombination frequency was also found in the participants. Our results indicated that complex chromosomal rearrangements can impair synaptic integrity of translocated chromosomes, which may reduce chromosomal recombination on translocated as well as non-translocated chromosomes, a phenomenon commonly known as interchromosomal effect.","complex chromosomal rearrangements, infertility, recombination, synaptonemal complex, transcriptional inactivation"
"An innovative non-discretisation mechanical-based method is developed in this paper to analyse a steel arch at elevated temperatures so that its behaviour can be quantified. The steel arch has a generic but singly-symmetric cross-section with elastic and plastic parts, and it is subjected to an arbitrary thermal profile which varies along the length of the arch as well as through the depth of the cross-section. The effects of geometric and material non-linearity as well as potential catenary action which can occur at high temperatures are taken into account in the formulation. The efficiency and accuracy of the generic model developed is demonstrated by a comparison with a finite element model undertaken using ABAQUS. The proposed method is then utilised to elucidate some significant factors, such as the magnitude of the temperature at bottom fibre of the cross-section as well as the ratio of the temperature at the top fibre to that at the bottom fibre, on the response of a steel arch member during fire loading. The proposed model provides a computationally superior formulation to that of commercial finite element packages, and forms a platform which can be used for structural steel arch design and evaluation in the development of codified approaches to fire design on a performance basis.","Non-linear material, Geometric non-linearity, Elevated temperatures, Non-discretisation model, Steel arch"
"Healthy women (N = 96) were investigated for changes in plasma renin activity (PRA) in abortion. In spontaneous abortion PRA levels were significantly lower than in induced abortion although higher than in healthy women. These findings may be explained by differences in corpus luteum function and renin production of the feto-placental unit. Alternatively, prostaglandins, released by the contracting uterus in spontaneous abortion may cause PRA suppression, as observed in 9 pregnant women with abortion induced by the intra-amniotic use of prostaglandin F2alpha.Plasma renin activity (PRA) in abortion was studied in 96 healthy women. In 10 spontaneous abortions PRA levels were significantly lower before and after abortion (p greater than .01 and greater than .001, respectively) than in 26 induced abortions although higher before abortion than in healthy women (p greater than .01 normal pregnancy; p greater than .001 nonpregnant luteal phase). These results may be explained by differences in corpus luteum function and renin production of the fetoplacental unit.

"The 2005 AISC Specification for Structural Steel Buildings is the leading specification for composite construction in the US. However, these provisions do not provide a recommendation for computing the strength of headed steel stud anchors (traditionally used as shear connectors) under tension or combined tension and shear. Headed stud anchors are subjected to these types of forces in composite structures such as infill walls, composite coupling beams, the connection region of composite columns, or composite column bases. While the ACI 318-08 Building Code , the PCI Handbook , 6th edition, and CEB Design of Fastenings in Concrete include provisions for such conditions, those provisions are geared for more general anchorage conditions than are typically seen in composite construction. It would thus be beneficial to have design guidance specifically for the case of headed steel stud anchors subjected to tension or combined tension and shear in composite construction, evaluated within the context of the AISC and EC-4 Specifications. In this work, different strength equations to compute the nominal tensile strength of a headed stud are reviewed and compared to experimental results. The resulting recommendations seek to ensure a ductile failure in the steel shank instead of a brittle failure within the concrete. Several criteria are proposed to ensure that ductile failure controls in composite construction, and, different headed stud configurations and detailing reinforcement recommendations are proposed to improve the ductile behavior of headed stud anchors subjected to tension and combined tension and shear.","shear stud, composite construction, shear connector, headed stud, composite wall, steel anchor, tensile strength"

"The bradyzoite stage of Toxoplasma gondii is a key step in the parasite life cycle. For a better understanding of this stage, a sensitive system to detect the tissue cysts would be required. In this study, we generated the T. gondii cyst-forming strain PLK expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under control of the dense granule protein 1 promoter, which works at both the tachyzoite and the bradyzoite stages. The bradyzoites with GFP fluorescence within both small and large cysts were detectable in the brain of mice infected with the recombinant PLK. Indeed, the bradyzoites expressing GFP had infectivity to mice. This study shows that transfection of the cyst-forming strain with GFP gene under control of the GRA1 promoter could be a useful approach for the study of the bradyzoite stage of T. gondii.","cyst, gfp, toxoplasma gondii, bradyzoite, life cycle, green fluorescent protein"
"Both the Basler model and the Rockey model developed during the early 1960s and 1970s predict reasonably well the postbuckling strength of plate girder web panels subjected to pure shear for panels having an aspect ratio (stiffener spacing/web depth) less than or equal to 1.5. The accuracy of these models deviates significantly when applied to panels with an aspect ratio equal to or greater than 3.0. The majority of all steel structures in the world have been designed and built based on these two major theories or their derivatives that recognize the reserve strength afforded by tension field action in the postbuckling stage. However, no single theory has ever emerged that explains the seemingly elusive stress distributions present in web panels during postbuckling until Yoo and Lee shed light on the true mechanics of web panel postbuckling behavior in shear. This paper revisits the validity of an arbitrary limit imposed by Basler on the maximum aspect ratio of a transversely stiffened web panel and develops a new method of predicting the ultimate shear strength of web panels with high aspect ratios.","Shear strength, Flange, Finite element analysis, Aspect ratio, Web panels, Tension field action, Transverse stiffener, Buckling"
"In this paper, we propose an efficient encoding and labeling scheme for XML, called EXEL, which is a variant of the region labeling scheme using ordinal and insert-friendly bit strings. We devise a binary encoding method to generate the ordinal bit strings, and an algorithm to make a new bit string inserted between bit strings without any influences on the order of preexisting bit strings. These binary encoding method and bit string insertion algorithm are the bases of the efficient query processing and the complete avoidance of re-labeling for updates. We present query processing and update processing methods based on EXEL. In addition, the Stack-Tree-Desc algorithm is used for an efficient structural join, and the String B-tree indexing is utilized to improve the join performance. Finally, the experimental results show that EXEL enables complete avoidance of re-labeling for updates while providing fairly reasonable query processing performance.","query processing, efficient query processing, update, insert-friendly bit string, new bit string, efficient xml encoding, ordinal bit string, dynamic xml data, binary encoding method, complete avoidance, bit string, preexisting bit string, xml, bit string insertion algorithm, indexation"
"To regulate mammalian water homeostasis, arginine-vasopressin (AVP) induces phosphorylation and thereby redistribution of renal aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels from vesicles to the apical membrane. Vice versa, AVP (or forskolin) removal and hormones activating PKC cause AQP2 internalization, but the mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that a fraction of AQP2 is modified with two to three ubiquitin moieties in vitro and in vivo. Mutagenesis revealed that AQP2 is ubiquitinated with one K63-linked chain at K270 only. In Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, AQP2 ubiquitination occurs preferentially when present in the apical membrane, is transiently increased with forskolin removal or PKC activation, and precedes its internalization. Internalization kinetics assays with wild type (wt) and ubiquitination-deficient (K270R) AQP2 revealed that ubiquitination enhances AQP2 endocytosis. Electron microscopy showed that a translational fusion of AQP2 with ubiquitin (AQP2-Ub) localized particularly to internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), whereas AQP2-K270R largely localized to the apical membrane, early endosomes, and the limiting membrane of MVBs. Consistent with this distribution pattern, lysosomal degradation was extensive for AQP2-Ub, low for AQP2-K270R, and intermediate for wt-AQP2. Our data show that short-chain ubiquitination is involved in the regulated endocytosis, MVB sorting, and degradation of AQP2 and may be the mechanism used by AVP removal and PKC-activating hormones to reduce renal water reabsorption. Moreover, because several other channels are also (short-chain) ubiquitinated, our data suggest that ubiquitination may be a general mediator for the regulated endocytosis and degradation of channels in higher eukaryotes.","aquaporin 2, mutation, cell line, protein binding, endocytosis, ubiquitin, water"
"Photorefractive crystals have emerged as ideal candidates for storing large amounts of optical image information. According to the Band Transport model, photorefraction results from absorption at various impurity levels inside the crystal. Thus an understanding of impurity levels within a photorefractive crystal will facilitate further understanding of photorefraction. Various methods have been employed to determine impurity levels inside photorefractive crystals (particularly BaTiO 3 , due to its fast response time). To date, most often quoted estimations of impurity levels are located between 0.3 and 0.8 eV for various BaTiO 3 samples. These estimations are deduced from experiments at temperatures above room temperature. This paper reports the first two-wave mixing experiments performed at temperatures below room temperature for which a BaTiO 3 crystal (doped with 20 ppm cobalt) is in orthorhombic phase and provides an estimation of the location of the shallow energy level in this crystal, which is approximately 0.1 eV above the valence band.","Low temperature, Barium titanate, Two-wave mixing, Shallow energy level"
"In an environment of constrained resources, policymakers must identify solutions for financing and delivering health services that are efficient and sustainable. However, such solutions require that policymakers understand the complex interaction between household utilization patterns, factors influencing household medical decisions, and provider performance. This study examined whether and under what conditions out-of-pocket, transportation, and time costs influenced Kenyan households' choice of medical provider for childhood diarrhoeal illnesses. It compared these decisions with the actual cost and quality of those providers to assess strategies for increasing the utilization of high quality, low-cost primary care. This study analyzed nationally-representative survey data through several multinomial nested logit models. On average, time costs accounted for the greatest share of total costs. Households spent the most time and transportation costs utilizing public care, yet were more likely to incur catastrophic time and out-of-pocket costs seeking private care for their child's diarrhoeal illness. Out-of-pocket, transportation, and time costs influenced households' choice of provider, though demand was cost inelastic and households were most responsive to transportation costs. Poorer households were the most responsive to changes in all cost types and most likely to self-treat or utilize informal care. Many households utilized informal care that, relative to formal care, cost the same but was of worse quality-suggesting that such households were making poor medical decisions for their children. To achieve public policy objectives, such as financial risk protection for childhood illnesses and equitable access to primary care, policymakers could focus on three areas: (1) refine financing strategies for further reducing household out-of-pocket costs; (2) reduce or subsidize time and transportation costs for households seeking public and private care; and (3) increase transparency of costs and quality to improve household decisions.",": Costs, diarrhoea, economic evaluation, health care seeking behavior, health financing, health services research, quality of care"
"In rats, the subcutaneous injection of a dopamine uptake inhibitor, nomifensine (40 mg/kg), induced a significant increase in the c-fos mRNA levels in the neocortex on postnatal days 23 and 49, in the striatum on days 8, 14, 23 and 49, and in the hippocampus on day 23, when compared with saline administration. The repeated injection with nomifensine (40 mg/kg once daily) from postnatal days 49 to 53 and from 23 to 27, but not from days 8 to 12 and 14 to 18, resulted in an enhanced stereotypy response elicited by a subsequent challenge of the drug (5 mg/kg) 21 days after the last injection (behavioral sensitization). The present results suggest that the neuronal circuits regulated by nomifensine might undergo regionally-different developmental changes, which could be implicated in the development of behavioral expressions including nomifensine-induced stereotypy sensitization.","nomifensine, hippocampus, striatum, behavioral sensitization, postnatal development, neocortex, c-fos mrna, dopamine"
"In highly competitive environments, such as retail markets, characterized by a growing heterogeneity of demand and the proliferation of new retail formats, cross-shopping behavior between stores and formats is becoming increasingly common. This process makes customer loyalty a key strategic challenge for retailers that want to consolidate their position within the market. To contribute to the analysis and comprehension of this reality, the authors propose and assess different objective indicators of store loyalty, store format loyalty, and intra-format store loyalty based on budget allocation. Specifically, they analyze the role of retail format in observable loyalty patterns in a market. Through an empirical analysis of grocery purchase patterns of a sample of 580 Spanish households, the authors find that diverse objective loyalty indicators based on budget allocations provide very similar information from a practical point of view. They also find that consumers' regular use of various formats (specifically, supermarkets, hypermarkets, and discount stores) for their purchases explain observed disloyalty better than does purchasing in several stores within these formats. The observed patterns reveal that retail formats define differentiated store profiles that relate to the benefits sought in different purchase situations.","grocery retailing, store format loyalty, store loyalty, behavioral measures of loyalty, customer loyalty"
"Large changes in land use and land management, which have had a tremendous impact on soil nutrients, have occurred in north China in recent years. In order to evaluate soil-nutrient changes, 124 samples in surface soil (0 to 20 cm) were collected in a 416.16 km 2 plain region in Zunhua County of Hebei province in 1999 and compared to 1980 results from the Second National Soil Survey. The average contents of available potassium, available phosphorus, and organic matter in 1999 were significantly higher than in 1980 (p < 0.1%). The nugget-to-sill ratio of available potassium decreased from 56.5% in 1980 to 41.1% in 1999, while the nugget-to-sill ratio of available phosphorus increased from 45.5% in 1980 to 54.1% in 1999. The ratio of organic matter changed from 60% in 1980 to 32.3% in 1999. The ranges of available potassium and available phosphorus between the years of 1980 and 1999 were similar. The range of organic matter was 4.8 km in 1980, decreasing to 2.7 km in 1999. Thus, the effects of human activities linked with land, such as land use and tillage, on spatial variation differed for each of the three soil properties examined.","Geostatistics, Land use, Soil nutrients, Tillage, Variability"
"We propose a differential operator for computing the residues associated with a class of meromorphic n-forms that frequently appear in the Cachazo-He-Yuan form of the scattering amplitudes. This differential operator is conjectured to be uniquely determined by the local duality theorem and the intersection number of the divisors in the n-form. We use the operator to evaluate the one-loop integrand of Yang-Mills theory from their generalized CHY formulae. The method can reduce the complexity of the calculation. In addition, the expression for the 1-loop four-point Yang-Mills integrand obtained in our approach has a clear correspondence with the Q-cut results.","Scattering Amplitudes, Conformal Field Theory, Differential and Algebraic Geometry, Supersymmetric gauge theory"
"In rats sham fed through esophageal fistulas, responsiveness to sucrose over a range of concentrations was assessed under two conditions: immediately following a large intragastric (IG) preload of liquid diet, and after 10 h of deprivation with no preload. The preload had no reliable effect on sucrose sham feeding at any sucrose concentration. Therefore, the insensitivity of sham feeding to IG loads is not confined to intense or highly palatable oral stimuli, but extends even to minimally effective ones.","Sucrose Concentration, Cholecystokinin, Liquid Diet, Pimozide, Esophageal Fistula"
"Given a set of n real numbers with a nonnegative sum, consider the family of all its k-element subsets with nonnegative sums. How small can the size of this family be? We show that this problem is closely related to a problem raised by Ahlswede and Khachatrian in [1]. The latter, in a special case, is nothing else but the problem of determining a minimal number c n (k) such that any k-uniform hypergraph on n vertices having c n (k) + 1 edges has a perfect fractional matching. We show that results obtained in [1] can be applied for the former problem. Moreover, we conjecture that these problems have in general the same solution.","perfect fractional matching, special case, n vertex, n real number, former problem, nonnegative sum, k-uniform hypergraph, nonnegative k-subset sum, k-element subsets, minimal number c n"
"This paper reports the results of a study of the incidence of A, B, O. and AB blood groups in 700 patients with cervical cancer. Reports of studies by others are quoted. Patients had been admitted to wards of S.N. Hospital, Agra. The diagnoses of cervical cancer had been established by clinical, cytological, and histopathological examinations. ABO blood groups were determined by the slide method using standard Anti-A and Anti-B sera. The grouping was confirmed by serum grouping using known group A and group B cells. A control series consisted of 2000 healthy females. Although and increased incidence of cervical cancer was observed incidence of cervical cancer was observed among patients belonging to group O, as compared to controls, statistical analysis of data revealed no significant difference. The chi square for 3 degrees of freedom was 5.875. Conclusions were that no significant statistical difference in the A,B,O, and AB blood groups distribution was present among these 700 patients with cancer of the uterine cervix.","Asia, Cancer, Cervical Cancer, Developing Countries, Diseases, India, Neoplasms, Southeastern Asia, Southern Asia"
"Within the framework of Rotter's Social Learning Theory of Personality, the authors sought to rate current personal adjustment through an analysis of past behavior which had resulted in social reinforcement in successful achievement and satisfaction or failure and dissatisfaction in arriving at certain goals to satisfy needs. A social reinforcement index was derived from two kinds of protocols: ""(a) a psychologist's descriptions of Ss' behavior in various areas of their life, and (b) recorded interviews with Ss concerning these areas."" The index ratings were found to have high interrater and intrarater reliability, when the ratings of two independent individuals were compared.

"Educational risks were investigated among 73 children 6 to 11 years old from homeless families staying in a Minneapolis shelter. Families were recruited at the shelter and followed up after they had moved into their own housing. Access to school was not a problem. However, significant school success problems, defined in terms of achievement and classroom behavior, were found among the 59 African American children who were the primary focus of analysis. Moreover, academic and behavioral problems often co-occurred, as did good achievement and good behavior. Results support the feasibility of research with highly mobile families whose children have extremely high risk for educational problems. Implications are discussed for researchers and educators who share the goal of fostering school success among high-risk mobile children.","Homeless, Children, Education, Risk, Resilience"
"Groin or femoral hernias may be concealed behind intact peritonea when the laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) mesh technique is used. The aim of this study was to determine the causes, frequency, and surgical procedures in cases of clinically diagnosed hernias without peritoneal defects.A prospective controlled study comprising 1795 consecutive patients undergoing 2190 laparoscopic TAPP herniorraphies was conducted. All hernias were first subjected to clinical investigations by the surgeons. Intraoperatively, all suspicious hernias were examined with regard to the presence of peritoneal hernial sacs.Of 2190 hernias, no hernia was seen transperitoneally in the laparoscopic procedures in 136 cases (6.2%). Forty-one femoral hernias (30.1%) were concealed behind intact peritonea. Forty-six lateral (33.8%) and 31 medial (22.8%) defects were sacless sliding fatty inguinal hernias.When using the TAPP technique, in addition to femoral hernias, especially sacless sliding fatty inguinal hernias may be overlooked because of intact peritonea. Therefore, in cases of clinically diagnosed inguinal hernias, the preperitoneal space should be inspected intraoperatively to avoid unsatisfactory results.","laparoscopic herniorrhaphy, preperitoneal pathology, overlooked hernia, sac-less hernia, femoral hernia"
"In making decisions, people have to balance between the competing demands of speed and accuracy, a balance generally referred to as the speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT). In this study, we investigated the role of controlled SAT in a two-choice task in which manual responses were either validly or invalidly cued. Examining electrophysiological measurements of oscillatory brain activity, theta power in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), alpha power in the occipital cortex, and beta power in the motor cortex were found to be related to SAT. Because oscillatory effects of SAT were found to emanate from the SAT baseline interval preceding the two-choice task, the results indicate that SAT is modulated by a change of visuo-motor baseline activities rather than a change of response threshold. Moreover, in the two-choice task, conflict-induced theta power in the ACC was found to be more pronounced in speed than in accuracy trials, whereas priming-related beta power dynamics in the motor cortex were unaffected by SAT. These results indicate that conflict processing, but not response priming, depends on SAT.","ergonomics, injury prevention, occupational safety, human factors, suicide prevention, response priming"
"A wide range of export promotion programs is available around the world to help firms penetrating export markets. However, firms must first be aware of the availability of these promotion programs before they can make use of them. This study examines the channels through which Malaysian firms obtain information on export promotion programs, and assesses the level of awareness of 13 such programs among Malaysian firms in four industry groups. Data collected from 53 manufacturing firms indicated that the available sources of information on export programs were not readily consulted, and the firms' overall awareness of export programs was not high. The results suggested that government agencies, in particular, need to do more to promote their role in developing external trade. Creating a higher level of awareness of export promotion tools, particularly among small- and medium-sized firms, should be given greater emphasis.","export information, exporter characteristics, export incentives, grouped data"
"A new type of active power filter(APF) with cycle discrete controller on DC bus voltage is proposed. The proposed cycle discrete controller can maintain the stability of DC bus voltage and simultaneously get active power filter command current by exploiting the periodicity of source current and energy balance concept. Hence, the instantaneous harmonic compensation and linear DC bus voltage control are achieved, using this technique. This controller is simple and stable in comparison with other control methods. A mathematical model of the scheme is developed. Detailed analysis and simulation in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment are presented. A laboratory prototype of this APF is developed to validate the result. Both of simulation and experimental results show the good behavior of the proposed APF.","Compensation, Cycle discrete controller, Harmonic current, Power filter, PWM, Reactive power"
"We previously reported that patients with idiopathic reactive hypoglycemia (plasma glucose concentration lower than 2.5 mmol/L 2-4 h after the ingestion of 75 g of glucose) display reduced or absent counterregulatory response of the glucagon secretion and increased insulin sensitivity. In order to examine the effect of glucagon on the increased insulin sensitivity in these patients, 12 subjects with idiopathic reactive hypoglycemia underwent a two-step hyperinsulinemic (1 mU/kg.min) euglycemic glucose clamp and were compared with 12 normal control subjects matched for age, weight and sex. During the first step of the glucose clamp (only insulin + glucose infusion) the patients with Idiopathic Reactive Hypoglycemia required higher glucose infusion rates to maintain euglycemia than normal subjects (9.09 +/- 0.29 mg/kg. min vs 7.61 mg/kg.min). When basal glucagon secretion was replaced (+ somatostatin and glucagon, second step of the clamp) the glucose infusion rates required to maintain euglycemia in patients with Idiopathic Reactive Hypoglycemia significantly decreased (to 7.17 +/- 0.40 mg/kg.min) and resulted similar to normal subjects (7.64 +/- 0.41 mg/kg.min). Thus, in patients affected by Idiopathic Reactive Hypoglycemia, glucagon secretion may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the increased insulin sensitivity and hypoglycemia.","Oral glucose tolerance test, hypoglycemia, insulin sensitivity, glucagon"
"A decoupling control method based on artificial neural network (ANN) inverse system theory was applied for the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), which was a nonlinear and high coupling system. The analytical inverse system of PMSM was obtained by analyzing the reversibility of the mathematical model, which is constituted by two pseudo-linear subsystems, first-order linear flux subsystem and second-order speed subsystem. The dynamic decoupling control between flux and speed of PMSM were realized by using PID algorithm to design closed-loop controller for the two subsystems. The dSPACE platform was built to realized the ANN inverse system control method for a real PMSM, and to obtain the data, which was sampled to train the ANN. The results show that ANN inverse system control strategy was of a high dynamic performance for PMSM, even though there were different ways of load torque disturbance.","Artificial neural network inverse system, Decoupling control, Flux, Permanent magnet synchronous motor, PID controller, Speed"
"The aeration of a liquid body advancing over a slow moving liquid layer in a pipe has been experimentally investigated with a conductance method. The 50 mm i.d. pipe section was close to horizontal and the fluids were air and water at atmospheric conditions. It has been found that net gas entrainment only occurs when the relative velocity between the advancing front and the liquid layer is greater than a limiting value. The rate of gas entrainment is proportional to the relative velocity between the advancing slug and the liquid layer, and to the interfacial width of the layer. Measured pressure drops, film heights and gas volume fractions in the advancing slug agree well with available correlations or with similar measurements taken under conditions of fully developed slug flow.","bubble production, slug flow, void fraction, liquid aeration, gas entrainment"
"In today's business where speed is of essence, an iterative development approach that allows the functionality to be delivered in parts has become a necessity and an effective way to manage risks. In this paper we propose the timeboxing model for iterative software development in which each iteration is done in a time box of fixed duration, and the functionality to be built is adjusted to fit the time box. By dividing the time box into stages, pipelining concepts are employed to have multiple time boxes executing concurrently, leading to a reduction in the delivery time for product releases. We illustrate the use of this process model through an example of a commercial project that was successfully executed using the proposed model.","process model, timeboxing model, iterative software development, life cycle process, multiple time box, iterative development, iterative development approach, software process, pipelining, fixed duration, process models, delivery time, timeboxing, time box, commercial project, software development, life cycle"
"Recent research in software engineering has produced a number of techniques for structuring an understanding of systems. Many of these techniques are applicable to the design of embedded computer systems and produce designs whose structures are easily expressible in the ada language. This language is itself structured so that the design of a system can be expressed independently of its implementation. Thus ada can be a useful system design language (SDL) with these techniques. This paper describes the software design problem in the development of embedded computer systems. It shows how ada can be used as an SDL, as well as a system implementation language. The essential point is that as an SDL ada encourages designers to use recent theory to develop better structures for their systems, and its subsequent use to implement the systems preserves those structures in the product.","subsequent use, embedded computer system, useful system design language, recent theory, system implementation language, software design problem, ada language, software engineering, recent research, sdl ada, computer architecture, interfaces, system design, embedding, methodology, systems engineering, high level languages, information processing"
"Research from both developed and developing countries has shown that various indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) are inversely associated with infant and child mortality. However, findings on the association between SES and morbidity are less clear. The impact of SES upon diarrheal and respiratory morbidity among children aged 5 years or less was assessed through a survey of mothers in 2 of Kuwait's 5 major residential areas. Findings are based upon interviews conducted during January-March 1994 with the mothers of 781 children of maximum age 5 years in a sample of Kuwaiti households. Only Kuwaiti nationals were included in the study. Higher SES women used health care facilities relatively more often. However, after controlling for relevant demographic factors, the effect of SES upon morbidity varied for diarrheal and respiratory illnesses. There were no significant differences in the reported morbidity due to diarrheal illness in either the 2 areas or the various SES groups. An inverse association was identified between SES level and morbidity due to respiratory illness, with children in the low and medium SES groups having higher respiratory morbidity than those in the high SES group.","age factors, arab countries, asia, child, demographic factors, developing countries, diarrhea, diseases, economic factors, infections, kuwait, measurement, morbidity, population, population characteristics, prevalence, research methodology, research report, respiratory infections, social class, socioeconomic factors, socioeconomic status, western asia, youth, developed countries"
"Bone mineral density (BMD), an important measurable predictor of osteoporotic fractures, is used as a surrogate definition of osteoporosis, and often as an end point in clinical trials. However, BMD is measured with random error and random fluctuation within individuals. This study addresses two specific questions: Given an observed level of BMD for an individual, what is the individual's likely ""true"" level? To what extent does an observed BMD change reflect a real change? A Bayesian model was formulated to address these questions, using data from the Dubbo Osteoporosis Epidemiology Study, past clinical trials, and a short-term reliability study in individuals ages 60 yr and older. Measurements of lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD by dual X-ray absorptiometry are highly reliable, with coefficients of reliability ranging from 0.90 to 0.99. Consequently, for an individual, there is good agreement between observed and ""true"" BMD values. However, the 90% confidence interval for the true level in elderly people and those with low measured BMD values is particularly wide. Using the cutoff of 2.5 standard deviations below the young normal mean as a definition of osteoporosis, the rates of false positives and false negatives can be as high as 20% among individuals ages 80 yr and older. In a typical clinical trial with an overall average increase in BMD of 2%, for a subject whose baseline femoral neck BMD is 0.80 g/cm(2), no conclusion of significant change could be drawn until an observed increase of at least 5.5% or an observed decrease of at least 7.5%. If two measurements were taken at baseline and follow-up, the true change could be detected with an observed increase of 3.5% or an observed decrease of 5%. On the other hand, there needs to be an observed increase of 6.2 and 8.5% before one can be 90% certain that a true increase of 2 and 5%, respectively, has occurred in an individual. This analysis suggests that the diagnosis of osteoporosis based on a single measurement of BMD and point estimates of changes in BMD may be inappropriate and unreliable. We propose that the current practice of informing individuals who have BMD measurements about their actual T- and Z-scores be replaced with a system of reporting in which their osteoporosis probability risk category is conveyed. Also, assessment of change in an individual should take into account the overall change in a population.","regression toward the mean, reproducibility, osteoporosis, bone mineral density, diagnosis, bayesian model"
"We investigate the role of perceived risk in consumers' adoption of risk-reducing strategies in the context of household investment decisions. Specifically, we examine behavioral responses intended to handle both the uncertainty and importance dimensions of perceived risk, incorporating risk propensity as another construct affecting risk-induced behaviors. We find that higher self-efficacy, greater wealth position, and risk-taking propensity lower an individual's perceived risk for investing in the stock market. We also find that perceived risk increases both the amount of information search and transaction frequency while it lowers the proportion of assets invested in the stock market. Risk propensity, on the other hand, increases the likelihood of obtaining investment advice from professionals, as well as the proportion of assets invested in the stock market.","risk propensity, perceived risk, information search, investment decisions, amount at stake, risk taking, self efficacy"

Frequency of medical and psychosocial conditions, including hospitalizations, perinatal distress, chronic medical illness, separation from caregivers, family turmoil/divorce, and abuse/neglect were recorded and compared with control records matched for sex. Results indicated that stimulant-treated children had significantly more histories in all categories; also, stimulant-treated children had more than twice as many actual medical and psychosocial events felt to be significantly threatening to a child. Results suggest that stimulant-treated children comprise a group at risk for a variety of medical and psychosocial adversities, but these factors do not appear to be considered during routine clinical management of these children.","medical trauma, psychosocial events, psychostimulants, attention deficit disorder, medical history"

"The capillary discharge soft X-ray laser scheme is a new way for generating small-size, table-top, high-efficient  and cost-effective X-ray laser. In order to obtain stable and high laser energy, it is necessary to optimize parameters related with laser output . The configuration of the main-switch directly determines the waveform of the main current which in turn influences laser output. By means of the study of three types of main-switch, it shows that the circuit inductance of the modified ring-small disk main-switch supported by parallel metal bars is feasible to achieve appropriate main current. It is also concluded that the average main current and average laser energy are increase by 4% and 31% respectively than those before modification, while the lasing probability is increaseed by 60 % than that of the original ring-large disk main-switch supported by circular metal pipe. Furthermore, under condition of larger and stable laser energy output, the modified main-switch still inherits the high-voltage resistance of ring-small disk main-switch supported by circular metal pipe, and keeps laser beam with narrow pulse width.","Capillary discharge, Laser technique, Lasing probability, Main-switch, Soft X-ray laser"
"Since the implementation of economic reforms in 1978 in the People's Republic of China, entrepreneurs have emerged as a new consumer group. With rising income and high consumption power, entrepreneurs have become major consumers for expensive goods and services. However, little research has been carried out to understand their consumption decisions. In this article, we study the consumption patterns of small business owners, getihu , in China by using a set of large-scale, nationwide survey data. Their consumption is postulated to be affected by (1) risk factors which include failure risk and financial (leverage) risk, (2) household variables such as the household size, financial and labor resources in the family, (3) the future plans of their business, and (4) home ownership. The effects of these factors on consumption patterns are evaluated. Our empirical results, based on regression and Tobit analysis, showed that all these factors are important in the consumption decisions of the entrepreneurs' households. In particular, risk and household factors are statistically significant in accounting for the variations in their consumption patterns. The marketing implications are also discussed.","entrepreneur, consumption, getihu, risk factors, statistical significance, survey data"
"Previous studies have shown that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) regulates exocrine pancreatic function in health and disease. As extracardiac sources of ANP have been identified and ANP-like immunoreactivity has been reported in the exocrine pancreas, in the present work we sought to establish whether ANP was produced in the rat exocrine pancreas and if conditions like fasting/feeding or acute pancreatitis were reflected on ANP expression. By using RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence microscopy assays, it was found that both mRNA and protein ANP were present in the acinar cells of the exocrine pancreas. The amount of ANP in the pancreas was lower in than the atrium but similar to other tissues like the kidney and liver. Immunogold labeling electron microscopy studies revealed that ANP was localized in zymogen granules and the endoplasmic reticulum suggesting local synthesis and package into granules. ANP protein expression was significantly increased not only in fasting but also in acute pancreatitis, the latter probably related to impaired secretion. Natriuretic peptide receptor type C which mediates ANP biological effects in the exocrine pancreas was also present in acinar cells and its expression did not change with either fasting or acute pancreatitis. Present findings show that the exocrine pancreas is a relatively important extracardiac source of ANP and further support previous studies strongly suggesting the active role of the peptide in pancreatic physiology and pathophysiology.","Natriuretic peptides, Pancreas, Acinar cells, Acute pancreatitis, Exocrine pancreas"

"With the increasing interest in multiphase flow in microchannels and advancement in interface capturing techniques, there have recently been a number of attempts to apply computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to model Taylor flow in microchannels. The liquid film around the Taylor bubble is very thin at low Capillary number ( Ca ) and requires careful modelling to capture it. In this work, a methodology has been developed to model Taylor flow in microchannel using the ANSYS Fluent software package and a criterion for having a sufficiently fine mesh to capture the film is suggested. The results are shown to be in good agreement with existing correlations and previous valid modelling studies. The role played by the wall contact angle in Taylor bubble simulations is clarified.","liquid film, taylor bubble, contact angle, microchannels, mesh resolution, multiphase flow, cfd"

We have proposed a mathematical meta-description of a flexible information storage model based on the experience gathered in cooperation in those projects. In this model, we use two basic structures called a knowledge base and data files. We describe those two structures using the graph theory concepts. Furthermore, we use logical formulas to express conditions that should be valid. Additionally, we present a description of a global system architecture of a 3-tier EHR application with interfaces based on the latest technologies; predominately on Web Services, SOAP, XML, HTTP, CORBA, etc. According to our experience and test results gained from the MUDR EHR usage, we describe an open universal solution, which can be applied as the EHR kernel of hospital information systems. To realize this approach in a daily practice for health professionals we have started a co-operative project with clinical information systems developers. Within that project we are developing a new system for continual shared health care.","data acquisition, data storage, data mining, knowledge base, web service, healthcare, software architecture, decision support, system architecture, graph theory"
"To review critically the past 10 years of research on youth suicide.Research literature on youth suicide was reviewed following a systematic search of PsycINFO and Medline. The search for school-based suicide prevention programs was expanded using two education databases: ERIC and Education Full Text. Finally, manual reviews of articles' reference lists identified additional studies. The review focuses on epidemiology, risk factors, prevention strategies, and treatment protocols.There has been a dramatic decrease in the youth suicide rate during the past decade. Although a number of factors have been posited for the decline, one of the more plausible ones appears to be the increase in antidepressants being prescribed for adolescents during this period. Youth psychiatric disorder, a family history of suicide and psychopathology, stressful life events, and access to firearms are key risk factors for youth suicide. Exciting new findings have emerged on the biology of suicide in adults, but, while encouraging, these are yet to be replicated in youths. Promising prevention strategies, including school-based skills training for students, screening for at-risk youths, education of primary care physicians, media education, and lethal-means restriction, need continuing evaluation studies. Dialectical behavior therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and treatment with antidepressants have been identified as promising treatments but have not yet been tested in a randomized clinical trial of youth suicide.While tremendous strides have been made in our understanding of who is at risk for suicide, it is incumbent upon future research efforts to focus on the development and evaluation of empirically based suicide prevention and treatment protocols.","treatment, prevention, epidemiology, risk factors, suicide, adolescence, ergonomics, occupational safety, human factors, injury prevention, suicide prevention"
"Excisional wound healing in inducible nitric oxide synthase knockout (iNOS-KO) mice has been previously shown to be impaired compared with their background strain controls. Incisional wounds were created in this experiment in both types of animals and paradoxically were found to heal with the same rapidity and breaking strength in both groups.Dorsal 2.5 cm incisional wounds were created in iNOS-KO mice, as well as their parental strain controls (C57BL/6J). Standardized polyvinyl alcohol sponges were implanted in the wounds to allow for measurement of collagen deposition. Animals were harvested on postoperative days (PODs) 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 28, and their wounds subjected to tensiometric breaking strength analysis. Nonisotopic in situ hybridization quantitative analysis for iNOS, endothelial NOS (eNOS), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and interleukin-4 (IL-4) expression in the wounds was performed. Hydroxyproline levels were quantitated in the harvested polyvinyl alcohol sponges. Data were analyzed with the Students t test.No significant differences were found in breaking strengths or levels of hydroxyproline (and thus collagen) in iNOS-KO versus wild-type wounds at all tested time points. Flawed iNOS expression levels in iNOS-KO animals were similar to (functional) iNOS expression in wild-types. eNOS and bFGF expression nearly doubled on POD 7 in iNOS-KO incisions (P =.002, and.002), respectively and remained 200% to 300% elevated thereafter. TGF-beta1 expression was increased approximately 50% to 100% in iNOS-KO wounds on PODs 5 and 7 (P =.006 and.01, respectively). VEGF and IL-4 expression was elevated by 25% to 100% in wild-type compared with iNOS-KO animals at all time points (P <.01).The overexpression of TGF-beta1 and eNOS may represent mechanisms in iNOS-KO mice to compensate for their loss of functional iNOS, resulting in incisional wound healing equivalent to controls. Their impaired expression of VEGF and IL-4, on the other hand, may partially explain the delayed excisional wound healing noted in these animals.","wild type, quantitative analysis, vascular endothelial growth factor, knockout mice, transforming growth factor"
"We examine the cost and performance advantages of immense main memories and of the use of extended storage units for a wide range of database applications. Most database systems are required to guarantee a close to absolute degree of data integrity. This requirement is a serious limitation on the usage of main memories as the primary repository of data because of the vulnerability of the content to errors, particularly, software related errors. Current research often neglects this point and focuses instead on the technological issues of the silicon memories content volatility. Transaction processing performance is mostly evaluated on the basis of throughput (i.e., transaction per second) provided that the average response time does not exceed 1 s. Most update intensive applications can be classified as transaction processing and therefore driven by throughput considerations. We will show that large memories have little effect on throughput. Given this point of view, there is very little (if any) performance advantage in using main memories for transaction processing. Consequently, the potential of the immense memory system is for improving the performance of those (non-updating) applications that execute complex queries. The coexistence of query applications with the updating transactions is a realistic view of most business systems as well as many engineering and scientific applications. By taking these facts into consideration, a new vision of in-memory databases is created. In this approach, hardware architecture changes are shown to be less important than the use of proper algorithms and software systems.","pragmatic approach, database system, immense memory, software systems, transaction processing, data integrity, hardware architecture"
"This paper presents a new approach to derive the image feature descriptor from the Dot-Diffused Block Truncation Coding (DDBTC) compressed data stream. The image feature descriptor is simply constructed from two DDBTC representative color quantizers and its corresponding bitmap image. The Color Histogram Feature (CHF) derived from two color quantizers represents the color distribution and image contrast, while the Bit Pattern Feature (BPF) constructed from bitmap image characterizes the image edges and textural information. The similarity between two images can be easily measured from their CHF and BPF values using a specific distance metric computation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed feature descriptor compared to the former existing schemes in image retrieval task under natural and textural images. The DDBTC method compresses an image efficiently, and at the same time, its corresponding compressed data stream can provide an effective way as feature descriptor for performing image retrieval and classificaton. Consequently, the proposed scheme can be considered as an effective candidate for real-time image retrieval applications.","Image retrieval, Image coding, Feature extraction, Image color analysis, Streaming media, Gray-scale, Histograms"
"Using a universal signaling assay employing G-protein chimeras comprising the C-terminal five amino acids of Gi1/2, Gi3, Go, and Gz fused to Gq, the calcium mobilizing G-protein, we explored the role of the C-terminus of Gi family G-proteins as a determinant for 5-HT(1A) receptor functional coupling. Co-expression of the 5-HT(1A) receptor with each of the Gq/Gi family chimeras resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in calcium upon addition of 5-HT, although the coupling efficiency differed dramatically. Gq/Gi3 resulted in the most efficient coupling based on both potency and relative maximum response to 5-HT. Gq/Go also produced efficient coupling in terms of relative 5-HT efficacy (76% of the Gq/Gi3 maximum response), although 5-HT exhibited 4-fold lower agonist potency, and Gq/Gz and Gq/Gi1/2 conferred poor functional coupling. Agonist potencies and relative efficacies determined for a number of 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists using Gq/Gi3 coupling were significantly weaker than those described previously for coupling through the native G-protein. These results indicate the C-terminus of Gi3 as an important determinant for coupling to the 5-HT(1A) receptor, while the reduced functional agonist activities suggest additional motifs participate in receptor/G-protein coupling.","calcium signaling, gi, chimera, g protein, amino acid"
"Although both differential susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and disease pathogenesis depend on a multitude of factors, elucidation of specific host genetic markers, particularly those in the human major histocompatibility complex, is important. The present study is an attempt to delineate human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I association in tuberculosis (TB) on the basis of a shared sequence motif in peptide-binding pockets of HLA molecules. In patients with pulmonary TB and miliary/disseminated TB, we observed significantly increased frequencies of A3-like supertypes and decreased frequencies of A1-like supertypes. These 2 positively and negatively associated supertypes (allele groups) share a similar peptide-binding motif, except for residues in pocket F of the HLA class I molecules. In addition, the HLA-Cw specificities that are major ligands for killer cell immunoglobulin-like (inhibitory) receptors (KIRs), particularly KIR2DL1 (Cw2, Cw4, and CW5) and KIR2DL2 (Cw1, Cw3, and Cw7), were found more frequently among patients with TB, which suggests a possible inhibition of natural killer cell activity against the infected target cells. The results of the present study suggest that the frequent occurrence of HLA class I specificities comprising an A3-like peptide-binding motif and the increased occurrence of ligands for KIR2DL in TB together may influence the outcome of TB.","human leukocyte antigen, physiology, developing countries, health, biology, medicine"
"In planning software process improvement activities, it is essential to determine the factors that most influence the success of a software project. In this article, we present an investigative and analytical framework for evaluating software process factors based on the Goal/Question/Metric (GQM) paradigm. We built descriptive models of the software process, defects, and cost. These models were used as a common basis of quantitative analysis in the study. We also developed evaluative models that clarify the relationship between the basic metrics, the analysis method, and the goals of the analysis. We confirmed the usefulness of our analytical framework, by applying it in an actual development environment at Matsushita Communication Industrial Company in Japan, where we studied four communications-software projects. This article reports the patterns we noted in the data and suggests process improvement activities based on those findings.","influential factor, software process improvement, gqm paradigm, goal question metric, development environment, quantitative analysis, software process"

We show how practices from the two fields support the company's strategic and tactical ambitions, respectively. We also discuss how the company integrates strategic, tactical and operational processes to optimize collaboration and consequently improve its ability to meet market needs, opportunities and challenges. The findings from this study are relevant to software product companies seeking ways to balance agility and product management.

"A finite strip method of analysis is presented for the inelastic local buckling of I-beams fabricated by welding. Stiffness and stability matrices for the section are developed at a monotonically increasing load factor, and the critical moment is that for which the buckling determinant vanishes. Critical moments determined in this way are shown to agree well with test results. The limiting depth-to-thickness ratios for the web which correspond to compact and semi-compact sections are investigated, and it is shown that the values given in BS 5950: Part I are unconservative for an extensive range of section geometries. Based on a parametric study, alternative and more accurate formulations for the critical web slendernesses are proposed.","behaviour, buckling, behavior, stress, structural analysis"
"In this study we quantify the impact of a partnership between a dedicated health clinic for government assisted refugees (GARs), a local reception centre and community providers, on wait times and referrals. This study used a before and after, repeated survey study design to analyze archived administrative data. Using various statistical techniques, outcomes for refugees arriving 18 months prior to the introduction of the clinic were compared with those of refugees arriving in the 18 months after the clinic was established. Our investigation revealed wait times to see a health care provider decreased by 30 % with the introduction of a dedicated refugee health clinic. The likelihood of GARs being referred to physician specialists decreased by 45 %, but those referred were more likely to require multiple referrals due to increasingly complex medical needs. Referrals to non-physician specialist health care providers nearly doubled following the availability of the clinic. The time-limited, but intense health needs of GARs, require an integrated community-based primary healthcare intervention that includes dedicated health system navigators to support timely, more culturally appropriate care and successful integration.","Before and after study, Refugee, Primary care, Canada"
"Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is hindered by limited efficacy and significant toxicity of second-line drugs. The need for new therapeutic options is critical to combat the global MDR-TB epidemic. Bedaquiline is a novel oral diarylquinoline approved by Food and Drug administration (FDA) for the treatment of adults with pulmonary MDR-TB on the basis of Phase IIb trial data under the provisions of the accelerated approval regulations for serious or life-threatening conditions. The FDA advisory committee members voted unanimously on efficacy data based on surrogate measures, however they were split on the issues of safety of bedaquiline. Main safety concerns include QT interval prolongation, hepatic related adverse events, and excess mortality in bedaquiline treated patients. While bedaquiline approval is a story of many firsts and certainly a welcome addition to the existing arsenal of anti-TB agents, a cautiously optimistic approach is required to assess the risk benefit profile of the drug. Acceleration of further Phase III trials and clinical studies is imperative, as is timely analysis of emerging data on the real world use of the drug. This mini review outlines the clinical pharmacology of bedaquiline highlighting the potential promises and challenges that implicate the risk benefit profile of drug.","bedaquiline, diarylquinoline, mdr-tb, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis"
"In epidemiological research the calculation of appropriate measures of disease frequency is the basis for a comparison of populations and, therefore, the identification of disease determinants. Two frequencies being compared can be combined into a single summary parameter that estimates the association between an exposure and a disease. This can be accomplished by calculating either the ratio of the measures of disease frequency for two populations which indicates how much more likely one population is to develop a disease than another, or the difference between the frequencies which indicates how much greater the frequency of a disease is in one population compared with the other. In epidemiology we often need to compute measures of disease frequency mentioned above. We can do that by means of complex statistical software, but sometimes it is not easy or possible to use this software for an analysis of epidemiological data. At the EuroMISE Center of Charles University and Academy of Sciences in the framework of the research supported from grant COPERNICUS JRP-10053 the E. T. program (Epidemiology Tools) was developed. This program can be used for practical analysis of data from retrospective (case-control) studies or prospective (cohort) studies and for standardization. However, the program can be also a useful teaching tool in the epidemiology courses.","Standardization, Case-control study, Epidemiology, Cohort study"
"We have previously observed that migraine attacks impervious to triptan therapy were readily terminated by subsequent i.v. administration of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ketorolac. Since such attacks were associated with periorbital allodynia--a symptom of central sensitization--we examined whether infusion of the NSAID naproxen can block sensitization of central trigeminovascular neurons in the medullary dorsal horn, using in vivo single-unit recording in the rat. Topical exposure of the cerebral dura to inflammatory soup (IS) for 5 min resulted in a short-term burst of activity (<8 min) and a long-lasting (>120 min) neuronal hyper-responsiveness to stimulation of the dura and periorbital skin (group 1). Infusion of naproxen (1 mg/kg) 2 h after IS (group 1) brought all measures of neuronal responsiveness back to the baseline values recorded prior to IS, and depressed ongoing spontaneous activity well below baseline. When given preemptively 1 h before IS (group 2), naproxen blocked the short-term burst of activity and every long-term measure of neuronal hyper-responsiveness that was studied in the central neurons. The same preemptive treatment, however, failed to block IS-induced short-term bursts of activity in C-unit meningeal nociceptors (group 3). The results suggest that parenteral administration of naproxen, unlike triptan therapy, can exert direct inhibition over central trigeminovascular neurons in the dorsal horn. Though impractical as a routine migraine therapy, parenteral NSAID administration should be useful as a non-narcotic rescue therapy for migraine in the setting of the emergency department.","headache, cox, is, migraine, wide-dynamic-range, nsaid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, inflammatory soup, wdr, pain, cyclooxygenase, nociception, trigeminal, single unit recording, dynamic range"
"Lifecycle validation of the performance of software products (i.e., the prediction of the product ability to satisfy the user performance requirements) encompasses the production of performance models from CASE documents.The model production activity is a critical, time-consuming and error-prone activity so that lifecycle validation is still not widely accepted and applied. The reason is twofold: the lack of methods for the automatic derivation of software performance models from CASE documents and the lack of environments that implement and integrate such methods.A number of methods for the automatic derivation of software performance models from CASE documents has been already proposed in literature, without however solving the automation problem. This paper instead faces up to such problem, by introducing an integrated and standards-based environment for the automatic derivation and evaluation of queueing-based performance models.The environment is based on the use of standards for metadata exchange (MOF, XMI), to ease the integration of the most common UML-based CASE tools, thus enabling software designers to smoothly introduce performance validation activities into their best development practices.","software design, satisfiability, metamodeling, software performance, case tool"
"Extracellular enzymes break down soil organic matter into smaller compounds and their measurement has proved to be a powerful tool to evaluate the functionality of soils. Urease is the enzyme that degrades urea and is widely considered to be a good proxy of nitrogen (N) mineralisation. But the methods available to measure this enzyme are time consuming; as such, urease is not commonly included in standard enzyme profiling of soils. We developed a fast, high throughput and reproducible colorimetric microplate technique to evaluate urease activity in soil. The method involves the incubation of soil slurries in 96-deepwell blocks with urea solutions and the measurement, by colorimetric reaction, of ammonium produced. We compared the new method with existing methods, yielding comparable results, and evaluated optimal conditions for urease analysis (soil slurry concentration, substrate concentration, incubation times and extractant salt concentration) in different grassland soils. The method proved to be a faster, higher throughput, and more precise alternative to existing methods for evaluating this important N-related enzyme.","Ammonium, Microplate method, Nitrogen cycle, Soil enzymes, Urea amidohydrolase"
"Real-time tasks are characterized by computational activities with timing constraints and classified into two categories: a hard real-time task and a soft real-time task. In hard real-time tasks, tardiness can be catastrophic. The goal of hard real-time tasks scheduling algorithms is to meet all tasks' deadlines, in other words, to keep the feasibility of scheduling through admission control. However, in the case of soft real-time tasks, slight violation of deadlines is not so critical. In this paper, we propose a new scheduling algorithm for soft real-time tasks using multiobjective genetic algorithm (moGA) on multiprocessors system. It is assumed that tasks have precedence relations among them and are executed on homogeneous multiprocessor environment. The objective of the proposed scheduling algorithm is to minimize the total tardiness and total number of processors used. For these objectives, this paper combines adaptive weight approach (AWA) that utilizes some useful information from the current population to readjust weights for obtaining a search pressure toward a positive ideal point. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is shown through simulation studies.","multiobjective genetic algorithm, total number, real-time task scheduling, hard real-time task, new scheduling algorithm, soft real-time task, proposed algorithm, real-time task, adaptive weight approach, total tardiness, proposed scheduling algorithm, real time, scheduling algorithm"
"This meta-analysis aimed to identify the accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) on the diagnosis of thyroid nodules. PubMed, Chinese Biomedical Medical databases (CNKI), Wan Fang (Chinese), and EBSCO database were searched from inception through April 15, 2015 without language and geographic restrictions. MetaDisc version 1.4 software was applied for this meta-analysis. We calculated the summary statistics for sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spe), positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR+/LR-), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve. Twenty-five eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis. A total of 424 in 1154 nodules is malignant thyroid tumors. After all thyroid lesions were histologically confirmed by CEUS, the pooled Sen was 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-0.91); the pooled Spe was 0.90 (95% CI 0.88-0.92). The pooled positive LR+ was 8.69(95% CI 5.78-13.09); the pooled negative LR- was 0.15 (95% CI 0.12-0.19). The pooled DOR of CEUS in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules was 63.18 (95% CI 37.82-105.53). The area under the SROC curve was 0.946 (standard error [SE] = 0.010). Our meta-analysis indicates that CEUS may have high accuracy in diagnosis the difference between benign and malignant thyroid nodules. US is a traditional tool in the diagnosis thyroid nodules. However, with the development of science and technology, the emerging of CEUS significantly improve accuracy in the diagnosis thyroid nodules.","Accuracy, CEUS, meta-analysis, nodules, thyroid, ultrasound contrast imaging"
"This study investigated factors which were protective to children living in disharmonious homes. The sample was drawn from a representative sample of children aged 9 to 12 who took part in a previous general population study. Semi-structured interviews with both parents were used to assess the quality of the parental marriage. Mothers provided information on children's emotional and behavioral problems and putative protective factors. Fifty-seven families were in the disharmonious marriage group and 62 were in the harmonious marriage group. Putative protective factors, hypothesized to be beneficial for children, were either an aspect of social support or related to children's activities. Data were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance with parental marriage and the putative protective factor as main effects. A differentiation was made between protective factors which interacted with parental marriage and those that acted independently. Factors which interacted with the quality of parental marriage were children having a relationship with an adult outside the family, an activity for which they received much positive recognition, and good sibling relationships. The parent-child relationship was associated with children's disturbance in both harmonious and disharmonious homes.","stress, children, marital disharmony, protective factors"
"First, to investigate whether there is covariation between risk behaviors, including suicidality, in a community probability sample of children and adolescents; and second, to investigate whether risk behavior is associated with selected potential correlates.A sample of 9- to 17-year-old youths (N = 1,285) and their caretakers were interviewed in the Methods for the Epidemiology of Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders (MECA) Study. The risk behaviors were marijuana smoking, alcohol use, intercourse, fighting, cigarette smoking, and suicidal ideation/attempts. Relationships between the risk behaviors were described using odds ratios. Linear regression analyses of an index of risk behavior on the selected potential correlates of risk behavior were conducted.There were significant relationships between all pairs of risk behaviors. The score on the index of risk behavior was associated with stressors, lack of resources, family psychiatric disorder, psychopathology, and functional impairment.Clinicians should be alerted to the possibility of risk behaviors, especially in children and adolescents engaging in other risk behaviors and those with inadequate resources, stressors, functional impairment, or psychopathology.","risk behavior, suicidality, injury prevention, human factors, suicide prevention, occupational safety, ergonomics"

"For the first time in some 36 years of experience with gastroschisis. the author has encountered in short order both his first and second cases of gastroschisis without any thickening of the eviscerated intestine. Both infants, whose gastroschisis had been detected by maternal alphafetoprotein and ultrasound studies, were delivered by elective preterm cesarean section and were repaired easily with closure of the abdomen in layers. It is suggested that the bowel thickening and rigidity in gastroschisis may result from the trauma of labor and delivery and that elective preterm section, as soon as lung maturity can be demonstrated, may substantially improve the ease of primary repair in gastroschisis.","elective cesarean, bowel thickening, labor trauma, improved repair, gastroschisis"
"This work deals with gravity localization on codimension-1 brane worlds engendered by compacton-like kinks, the so-called hybrid branes. In such scenarios, the thin brane behaviour is manifested when the extra dimension is outside the compact domain, where the energy density is non-trivial, instead of asymptotically as in the usual thick brane models. The zero mode is trapped in the brane, as required. The massive modes, although are not localized in the brane, have important phenomenological implications such as corrections to the Newton's law. We study such corrections in the usual thick domain wall and in the hybrid brane scenarios. By means of suitable numerical methods, we attain the mass spectrum for the graviton and the corresponding wavefunctions. The spectra possess the usual linearly increasing behaviour from the Kaluza-Klein theories. Further, we show that the 4D gravitational force is slightly increased at short distances. The first eigenstate contributes highly for the correction to the Newton's law. The subsequent normalized solutions have diminishing contributions. Moreover, we find out that the phenomenology of the hybrid brane is not different from the usual thick domain wall. The use of numerical techniques for solving the equations of the massive modes is useful for matching possible phenomenological measurements in the gravitational law as a probe to warped extra dimensions.","graviton, domain wall, mass spectrum, numerical methods"
"This paper proposes a stiffening method to meet some architectural needs. This method uses bolted channels as alternatives to both continuity and doubler plates in bolted moment-resistant beam-to-column connections. The present study investigates the performance of channels as stiffeners to: increase yield load in the tension zone of connection, gradually increase overall moment capacity of connection, and avert shear failure of the column web panel zone. We conducted experiments to examine the tension region of the connection loaded from T-stubs. The moment capacity of full connection was predicted by considering T-stub idealization and shear effects on the column web panel. T-stub tensile behavior and overall connection behavior were also monitored using three-dimensional finite element simulations in ANSYS simulation software because this problem is three-dimensional in nature. Effects of geometrical and material non-linearities on interaction among connecting members should be clarified. This study showed marked strength improvement in connection by use of channels. The performance of channel stiffeners was examined through comparison of results.","channel, stiffener, yield mechanism, finite element modeling, bolted moment connection, testing, beam-to-column joint, simulation software, three dimensional, finite element model"
"Although idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome(IHES) commonly involves the lung, it is rarely associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here we describe a case of IHES presented in conjunction with ARDS. A 37-year-old male visited the emergency department at Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, with a chief complaint of dyspnea. Blood tests showed profound peripheral eosinophilia and thrombocytopenia. Patchy areas of consolidation with ground-glass opacity were noticed in both lower lung zones on chest radiography. Rapid progression of dyspnea and hypoxia despite supplement of oxygen necessitated the use of mechanical ventilation. Eosinophilic airway inflammation was subsequently confirmed by bronchoalveolar lavage, leading to a diagnosis of IHES. High-dose corticosteroids were administered, resulting in a dramatic clinical response.","idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome, eosinophilia, pulmonary thromboembolism, drug therapy, respiratory system, platelets, hypoxia, diagnosis, bioinformatics, biomedical research"
"Chaotic time series prediction is a very important problem in many applications. The novel idea in this paper is to use principal components analysis (PCA) in conjunction with a novel wavelet neural network, multiwavelet neural network to successfully implement the prediction of chaotic time series. It is shown that the proposed method in this paper has two-fold contributions: (1) the multiwavelet network can essentially avoid the problem of poor convergence and undesired local minimum. (2) PCA can overcome the shortage that all the techniques developed for determining the embedding dimensions are inconvenient to be applied to small sample time series. The experiments also show that the proposed technique in this paper, multiwavelet network with PCA, is a more powerful tool for predicting chaotic series than other prediction techniques.","neural networks, wavelet transforms, chaotic communication, chaotic time series prediction, multiwavelet network, multiwavelets, wavelet neural network, principal components analysis, principal component analysis, signal detection, time series, neural nets, neural network"

"The use of sandwich panels in Australia has increased significantly in recent years due to their widespread structural applications in building systems. Structural sandwich panels generally used in Australia comprise of polystyrene foam core and thinner and high strength steel faces. The fully profiled sandwich panels, when subjected to axial compression and/or bending effects, are susceptible to local buckling failures. A research project was undertaken using a detailed experimental study on 50 foam supported steel plate elements to investigate the local buckling and postbuckling behaviour of sandwich panels and to examine the adequacy of currently used effective width approach for design. Experimental results have revealed that the current method is adequate for the steel plate elements with low b/t ratios. However, it appears to be inadequate for the plate elements with higher b/t ratios (slender plates). This paper presents the details of the experimental studies on polystyrene foam supported steel plates, the results, and the evaluation of current design rules for profiled sandwich panels subject to local buckling effects.","slender plates, profiled sandwich panels, effective width, local buckling"

"Members of the class B1 family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) whose ligands are neuropeptides have been implicated in regulation of circadian rhythms and sleep in diverse metazoan clades. This review discusses the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which class B1 GPCRs, especially the mammalian VPAC2 receptor and its functional homologue PDFR in Drosophila and C. elegans, regulate arousal and daily rhythms of sleep and wake. There are remarkable parallels in the cellular and molecular roles played by class B1 intercellular signaling pathways in coordinating arousal and circadian timekeeping across multiple cells and tissues in these very different genetic model organisms.","circadian, drosophila, g-protein coupled receptor, neuropeptides, sleep, suprachiasmatic nucleus, g protein coupled receptor"
"The formal specification of design patterns is widely recognized as being vital to their effective and correct use in software development. It can clarify the concepts underlying patterns, eliminate ambiguity and thereby lay a solid foundation for tool support. This paper further advances a formal meta-modeling approach that uses first-order predicate logic to specify design patterns. In particular, it specifies both structural and behavioural features of design patterns and systematically captures the variants in a well-structured format. The paper reports a case study involving the formal specification of all 23 patterns in the Gang of Four catalog. It demonstrates that the approach improves the accuracy of pattern specifications by covering variations and clarifying the ambiguous parts of informal descriptions.","pattern specification, formal specification, sequence diagrams, variants of patterns, design patterns, case study, design pattern, formal meta-modeling approach, informal description, graphic modeling, ambiguous part, behavioural feature, predicate logic, correct use, first-order predicate logic, meta model, structure formation, graphical model, software development, first order, sequence diagram"
"""This paper is a report of an experimental validation study of the Lowenfeld Mosaic Test. The method of group comparisons was used to determine whether there is justification for using the Mosaic Test in its present form as a clinical tool. Mosaic signs were compared to two criteria, psychiatric diagnosis and scores on the Wittenborn Psychiatric Rating Scales. The results of the study were sweepingly negative and it was concluded that there is no justification for continuing to use the Lowenfeld Mosaic Test in its present form. It was suggested that the discrepancies between clinical impressions and experimental findings may be attributed to failure to recognize that diagnostic cues are obtained from interview aspects of the testing situation, rather than from the Mosaic Test itself."" 19 references.

"In Mexico the Psorophora genus includes 24 species divided into 3 subgenera: Grabhamia, Janthinosoma, and Psorophora. Some species occur in the Nearctic region of the country (northern Mexico), whereas other species occur in the Neotropical region (southern Mexico), and a few species occur in both regions. In Quintana Roo, Mexico, 7 species have been previously recorded: Ps. confinnis s.s., Ps. champerico, Ps. cyanescens, Ps. ferox, Ps. lutzii, Ps. ciliata, and Ps. lineata. In October 2013, 24 females of Ps. albipes were collected using CDC light traps. This is the first record of this species in Quintana Roo.","First record, Mexico, Psorophora albipes, Quintana Roo"
"This paper describes finite element analysis of cold-formed rectangular hollow section (RHS) beams to predict the rotation capacity of Class 1 (Plastic) and Class 2 (Compact) beams. Introducing geometric imperfections into the model was essential to obtain rotation capacities that were close to the experimental results of bending tests on cold-formed RHS beams. A perfect specimen without imperfections achieved rotation capacities much higher than those observed experimentally. Introducing a bow-out imperfection, constant along the length of the beam, as was measured experimentally before fabrication, did not affect the numerical results significantly. To simulate the effect of the imperfections induced by welding the loading plates to the beams in the experiments, the amplitude of the bow-out imperfection was varied sinusoidally along the length of the beam, and restricted to a specific region within each beam. The magnitude of the geometric imperfections had an unexpectedly large influence on the rotation capacity of the specimens. Larger imperfections were required on the more slender sections to simulate the experimental results.","finite element analysis, rotation capacity, cold-formed steel, rhs, beams, local buckling"
"Hydrogen-gas etching of a 6H-SiC(0001) surface and subsequent annealing in nitrogen atmosphere leads to the formation of a silicon oxynitride (SiON) epitaxial layer. A quantitative low-energy electron diffraction analysis revealed that the SiON layer has a hetero-double-layer structure: a silicate monolayer on a silicon nitride monolayer via Si-O-Si bridge bonds. There are no dangling bonds in the unit cell, which explains the fact that the structure is robust against air exposure. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measured on the SiON layer shows a bulk SiO2-like band gap of approximately 9 eV. Great potential of this new epitaxial layer for device applications is described.","low energy electron diffraction, nitrogen, band gap, electron diffraction, double layer, scanning tunneling spectroscopy"
"In medicine, the use of neural networks has concentrated mainly on classification problems. Clinicians are often interested in knowing what a patient's status is compared with other similar cases. Compared with biostatistics neural networks have one major drawback: the reliability of the classification is difficult to express. Therefore, clear visualization of the measurements can be more helpful than the calculated probability of a disease. The self-organizing map is the most widely used neural network for data visualization. Although, visualization can be attached to almost any feed-forward network as well. In this paper, we describe a topology-preserving feed-forward network and compare it with the self-organizing map. The two neural network models are used in a case study on the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, which is a common female endocrine disorder characterized by menstrual abnormalities, hirsutism and infertility.","biostatistics neural network, neural network, topology-preserving feed-forward network, neural networks, data visualization, case study, neural network model, self-organizing map, polycystic ovary syndrome, calculated probability, clear visualization, classification problem, feed-forward network, clinical data, feed forward, self organizing map"
"Fly ash from municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerators contains leachable metals, including potentially hazardous heavy metals. The metal content of the fly ash can be reduced by thermal treatment, which vaporizes the volatile metal compounds. After heat treatment of fly ash at 1000 degrees C for 3 h, less metal was able to be leached from the thermally treated ash than from the ash without thermal treatment. Al and Cr were the exceptions. These metals were more soluble in the ash that had been thermally treated. This paper focuses on the leaching behaviour of Al only. Both simple and sequential extraction leaching tests showed that the leachable Al for the heat-treated fly ash is about twice that of the untreated fly ash. The sequential test further revealed that (i) the majority of the leachable Al is associated with Fe-Mn oxides in the fly ash, and (ii) most of the unleachable Al resides in the silicate matrices of the heat-treated and untreated fly ash. Pure chemicals, Al(2)O(3), CaO and CaCl(2), simulating the relevant ingredients in the fly ash, were used for studying their reactions at 1000 degrees C. The aluminum compounds were identified by X-ray Diffraction (XRD). Two new chemical phases produced by the thermal treatment were identified; Ca(AlO(2))(2) and 12CaO.7Al(2)O(3). Their formation suggests a mechanism whereby thermal treatment of fly ash would produce more soluble Al.","aluminum leachability, thermal treatment, msw fly ash, fly ash, x ray diffraction, heat treatment, municipal solid waste"
"Patients have the most to gain from reducing medical errors; yet, little research has been done to investigate the role they could or already do play in detecting and preventing errors in their own health care. The purpose of this study is to examine patient's role in detecting, preventing, and recovering from medical errors in outpatient oncology.In this paper, we use cognitive work analysis and Rasmussen's taxonomy of human performance to describe five cases of medical errors that occurred in an outpatient, cancer-care setting. We detail the role of the patient in each case, and analyze each role using constructs from previous studies of human behavior and errors.Observational data indicates that patients engage in a range of tasks that identify, prevent, and recover from medical errors in outpatient cancer care. The results of this study point to the importance of considering patients and their work in both the design of patient-care information systems and the structure of clinical-care environments that enable safe and effective health care.","medical errors, consumer health informatics, medical errors consumer health informatics information systems patient care medical oncology, medical oncology, patient care, information systems, health care, human performance, human behavior, information system"
"Parabolic trough solar thermal power plants are a proven technology in the utility scale since mid of the eighties. Between 1984 and 1991 nine power plants with an overall capacity of 354 MW have been installed in the Mojave Desert in California. Since, these power plants can be equipped with a thermal storage or a fossil back-up they offer a fully dispatchable electricity generation capacity. This technology will be a very interesting near term option for countries with high solar irradiation levels and small resources of fossil fuels like Jordan. This paper, discusses the use of parabolic trough solar thermal power plants for electricity production under Jordanian climate for two different sites (Amman, and Ma'an). An analysis of the daily power output, direct normal irradiation and the efficiency for the two sites has been carried out. The results showed that Ma'an site would be preferred than Amman site, so that it is recommended to erect the Parabolic Trough Concentrator (PTC) plant in the southern region of Jordan. Also this study aims to encourage the Jordanian government and the private sector to implement the solar thermal power plants for future expansion of power sector due to the increasing electricity demand and environmental degradation.","segs, renewable energy, solar thermal power plant, parabolic trough concentrator, solar irradiance, fossil fuels, power plant, electricity generation, environmental degradation, thermal power plant, private sector"
"Wave propagation in disordered media can be strongly modified by multiple scattering and wave interference. Ultimately the so-called Anderson-localized regime is reached when the waves become strongly confined in space. So far, Anderson localization of light has been probed in transmission experiments by measuring the intensity of an external light source after propagation through a disordered medium. However, discriminating between Anderson localization and losses in these experiments remains a major challenge. Here we present an alternative approach where we use quantum emitters embedded in disordered photonic crystal waveguides as light sources. Anderson-localized modes are efficiently excited and the analysis of the photoluminescence spectra allows to explore their statistical properties paving a way for controlling Anderson localization in disordered photonic crystals.","anderson localization, photonic crystal, wave propagation, quantum physics"
"The anthropogenic deforestation occurring throughout the tropical world is one of the great crises of our time. To better understand the dimensions of this problem, a number of studies have sought to quantify the extent and rate of tropical forest loss. However, environmental planners and managers need to know more than the extent and rate of tropical deforestation. There is a need for predictability, i.e. which areas are most susceptible to deforestation. This study demonstrates a methodology for predicting those areas with the greatest propensity for deforestation based on natural and cultural landscape variables. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine variables most closely associated with deforestation. The independent variables most strongly associated with the forested/deforested dependent variable were location of forested areas in relation to the forested/deforested edge in an earlier time period, to the location of access in an earlier time period, and to the location of habitation in an earlier time period. GIS analysis was then used to verify spatially the close statistical relationship between the dependent variable and each of the independent variables selected by the logistic regression modeling.","honduras, tropical deforestation, logistic regression, gis, statistical analysis, deforestation"
"A column splice is part of the column and therefore must be designed for second order bending moments and shear forces in addition to the axial force. In this paper strength and stiffness requirements for column splices are derived on the basis of column stability considerations. A strength requirement for the column splice is suggested based on an imperfect column. A stiffness requirement is suggested by allowing a 5% reduction in the Euler buckling load of the column. In order to test the suggested design requirements for column splices, full scale experimental tests on spliced columns were carried out. Three different column splices were investigated. Columns without splices were tested for reference purposes. All tests were performed three times. It has been found that splices can have a negative influence on the load carrying capacity of slender columns.","experiments, strength, testing, stiffness, splice, steel column, shear force, second order, carrying capacity"
"SAR image segmentation can be converted to a clustering problem in which pixels or small patches are grouped together based on local feature information. In this paper, we present a novel framework for segmentation. The segmentation goal is achieved by unsupervised clustering upon characteristic descriptors extracted from local patches. The mixture model of characteristic descriptor, which combines intensity and texture feature, is investigated. The unsupervised algorithm is derived from the recently proposed Skeleton-Based Data Labeling method. Skeletons are constructed as prototypes of clusters to represent arbitrary latent structures in image data. Segmentation using Skeleton-Based Fuzzy Clustering is able to detect the types of surfaces appeared in SAR images automatically without any user input.","feature extraction, fuzzy clustering, sar image, segmentation, skeleton-based, mixture model, image segmentation"
"This article examines how the electronic word of mouth (eWOM) information direction (positive vs. negative) and a website's reputation (established vs. unestablished) contribute to the eWOM effect. The article describes a study focusing on the moderating role of the product type (search vs. experience). The results of the experiment show that the eWOM effect is greater for negative eWOM than for positive eWOM, greater for established websites than for unestablished websites, and greater for experience goods than for search goods. The results support the moderating effects of product type on the eWOM information direction-website reputation-eWOM effect relationship. The impact of negative eWOM on the eWOM effect is greater for experience goods than for search goods. Similarly, the impact of website reputation on the eWOM effect is greater for experience goods than for search goods. The findings provide managerial implications for an Internet marketing strategy.","internet marketing, search goods, electronic word of mouth (ewom), experience goods, direction, website reputation, word of mouth"

These variables are plotted against each other for 15 Software Engineering Laboratory projects that were developed for NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center by Computer Sciences Corporation. Certain relationships are derived in the form of equations, and these equations are compared with a set derived by Walston and Felix for IBM Federal Systems Division project data. Although the equations do not have the same coefficients, they are seen to have similar exponents. In fact, the Software Engineering Laboratory equations tend to be within one standard error of estimate of the IBM equations.","staff size, software engineering laboratory, computer sciences corporation, software engineering laboratory equation, ibm equation, software engineering laboratory project, basic relationship, goddard space flight center, project duration, project data, programming measurement, ibm federal systems division, statistical analysis, productivity, software engineering, management"
"In recent years, a number of studies have been done on object tracking sensor networks (OTSNs) due to the wide applications. One important research issue in OTSNs is the energy saving strategy in considering the limited power of sensor nodes. The past studies on energy saving in OTSNs considered the object's movement behavior as randomness. In some real applications, however, the object movement behavior is often based on certain underlying events instead of randomness completely. In this paper, we propose a novel data mining algorithm named TMP-Mine with a special data structure named TMP-Tree for efficiently discovering the temporal movement patterns of objects in sensor networks. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on mining the movement patterns associated with time intervals in OTSNs. Moreover, we propose novel location prediction strategies that utilize the discovered temporal movement patterns so as to reduce the prediction errors for energy savings. Through empirical evaluation on various simulation conditions and real dataset, TMP-Mine and the proposed prediction strategies are shown to deliver excellent performance in terms of scalability, accuracy and energy efficiency.","data mining, location prediction, movement pattern, sensor networks, energy saving, novel location prediction strategy, proposed prediction strategy, movement behavior, sensor network, temporal movement pattern, prediction error, temporal movement patterns, object tracking, object movement behavior, data mining approach, energy efficient strategy, energy efficiency, data structure, energy efficient"

These efforts have included the spawning of national health informatics associations in some countries, creating opportunities for cross-country scientific interactions at national health informatics meetings and promoting regional health informatics activities and expertise through the APAMI web site. This presentation gives a review of the current status of health informatics activities among APAMI member countries as well as a cross-section of some of their health informatics projects.","health informatics, asia pacific, telemedicine, cross section"
"Microtubules are known to drive chromosome movements and to induce nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis and meiosis. Here we show that microtubules can enforce nuclear envelope folding and alter the levels of nuclear envelope-associated heterochromatin during interphase, when the nuclear envelope is intact. Microtubule reassembly, after chemically induced depolymerization led to folding of the nuclear envelope and to a transient accumulation of condensed chromatin at the site nearest the microtubule organizing center (MTOC). This microtubule-dependent chromatin accumulation next to the MTOC is dependent on the composition of the nuclear lamina and the activity of the dynein motor protein. We suggest that forces originating from simultaneous polymerization of microtubule fibers deform the nuclear membrane and the underlying lamina. Whereas dynein motor complexes localized to the nuclear envelope that slide along the microtubules transfer forces and/or signals into the nucleus to induce chromatin reorganization and accumulation at the nuclear membrane folds. Thus, our study identified a molecular mechanism by which mechanical forces generated in the cytoplasm reshape the nuclear envelope, alter the intranuclear organization of chromatin, and affect the architecture of the interphase nucleus.","Microtubules, Nuclear envelope, Lamins, Chromatin, Dynein"
"Resistance spreads rapidly in pathogen or pest populations exposed to biocides, such as fungicides and antibiotics, and in many cases new biocides are in short supply. How can resistance be reversed in order to prolong the effectiveness of available treatments? Some key parameters affecting reversion of resistance are well known, such as the fitness cost of resistance. However, the population biological processes that actually cause resistance to persist or decline remain poorly characterized, and consequently our ability to manage reversion of resistance is limited. Where do susceptible genotypes that replace resistant lineages come from? What is the epidemiological scale of reversion? What information do we need to predict the mechanisms or likelihood of reversion? Here, we define some of the population biological processes that can drive reversion, using examples from a wide range of taxa and biocides. These processes differ primarily in the origin of revertant genotypes, but also in their sensitivity to factors such as coselection and compensatory evolution that can alter the rate of reversion, and the likelihood that resistance will re-emerge upon re-exposure to biocides. We therefore argue that discriminating among different types of reversion allows for better prediction of where resistance is most likely to persist.","antimicrobials, biocides, fungicides, reversing resistance"
"Family roles are categorized into 5 functional entities: solidarity, sexuality, internal instrumentality, external relations, and division of responsibility. Within any of these, discrepancy between role expectations and role enactments leads to self-devaluation and thus to sometimes extreme behaviors which are designed to reinstitute role patterns which allow for positive self-evaluation. This extreme ""symptomatic"" behavior can be eliminated by assisting the family to reorganize roles so as to allow role-expectation gratification. Such interventions are more effective in areas of daily routine duties and responsibilities than in areas of solidarity or sexuality; the latter appear to respond epiphenomenally and self-correctively when other role frictions are eliminated. 3 case studies are presented, and principles for therapeutic intervention are suggested.

"Patterns of internationalization processes in industrializing countries seem to differ from the pattern in developed countries as they are reflected in the Uppsala and Innovation models. This study investigates the internationalization process of firms from a newly industrialized economy (NIE) in a mature product sector. The study employs two theoretical perspectives derived from (1) location-centered economic development theories and (2) the firm-centered theories of foreign direct investment (FDI). It explains why firms with few product-oriented specific ownership advantages in an industrializing economy successfully engage in production-related FDI (even from their start-up), and why the elapsed time from start-up to FDI is becoming shorter as the local sector develops. The paper also examines production location choices, showing that tolerance to psychic (cultural) distance increases with successive investments. The hypotheses derived are tested using FDI data from the garment industry of Hong Kong.","internationalization process, mature industry, newly industrialized economy, industry evolution, psychic distance, economic development, developing country, foreign direct investment"
"This paper describes a standardised computer-based information system for electroencephalography (EEG) focusing on epilepsy. The system was developed using a prototyping approach. It is based on international recommendations for EEG examination, interpretation and terminology, international guidelines for epidemiological studies on epilepsy and classification of epileptic seizures and syndromes and international classification of diseases. It is divided into: (1) clinical information and epilepsy relevant data; and (2) EEG data, which is hierarchically structured including description and interpretation of EEG. Data is coded but is supplemented with unrestricted text. The resulting patient database can be integrated with other clinical databases and with the patient record system and may facilitate clinical and epidemiological research and development of standards and guidelines for EEG description and interpretation. The system is currently used for teleconsultation between Gentofte and Lisbon.","telecommunication, information system, epilepsy, database, eeg, standardisation, electroencephalography"
"To assess whether this compound (ALH-L1005) is conceivably an effective agent in protecting against cochlear damage induced by LPS.Tube formation using human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 inhibition assay was performed. 24 guinea pigs were randomly divided into three groups. Intratympanic instillation of LPS (n=8) as negative control, instillation of oxytetracycline 1h after LPS as positive control (n=8), and intratympanic instillation of ALH-L1005 (n=8) 1h after LPS were considered experimental group. Evaluation by auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurement, cochlear blood flow, and blood-labyrinth barrier (BLB) permeability were performed. Cochlear hair cells were observed by field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). MMP-9 activation was measured by gelatin zymography.For HUVEC, the tube formation was suppressed in a dose dependant manner. ALH-L1005 inhibited the MMP-9 activity prominently. It also attenuated the elevation of LPS-induced hearing threshold shift and recovery of CBF. By FE-SEM, cochlear hair cells could be preserved in experimental group. ALH-L1005 significantly reduced the BLB opening compared to LPS group. Active MMP-9 expression could be detected in the LPS group. In contrast to ALH-L1005 group, active MMP-9 expression was not detected.Our results conclude that ALH-L1005 showed a protective effect in the cochlear lateral wall damage induced by LPS.","damage, horse chestnut, inner ear, lipopolysaccharide"
"Drawing on Miles and Snow's classification of strategy type, this paper addresses the contingency role that competitive intensity plays in explaining the relationship between exploration/exploitation and firm performance. We further refine our firm performance measure into separate measures of effective and efficient firm performance. Our conceptual argument posits that for defenders, exploration will be positively related to effective firm performance while exploitation will be negatively related to efficient firm performance as competitive intensity increases. Conversely, for prospectors, we assert that exploration will be negatively related to effective firm performance, whereas exploitation will be positively associated with efficient firm performance as competition intensifies. Empirical results provide general support for our predictions. The implications for business theory and practice are discussed.","miles and snow typology, efficient firm performance, exploration, competitive intensity, exploitation, effective firm performance"
"Three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical Pt-Cu tetragonal, highly branched, and dendritic superstructures have been synthesized by a facile template-free hydrothermal approach, showing growth patterns along (111, 110), (111), and (100) planes, respectively. These structures have been characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and a detailed formation mechanism has been developed, which shows that the in situ formed I2 and the galvanic replacement reaction between Cu and Pt4+ may guide the formation of these superstructures. The comparative electrocatalytic properties have been investigated for methanol and ethanol oxidation. Due to their interconnected arms, sufficient absorption sites, and exposed surfaces, these superstructures exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic performance for electro-oxidation of methanol and ethanol when compared with commercial Pt/C and Pt black.","noble metal, alloy, hierarchical structures, electrocatalysis"
"Respiratory failure in newborns with abdominal wall defects has been attributed to increased intra-abdominal pressure and elevation of the diaphragm after closure. Despite surgical techniques designed to minimize intra-abdominal pressure, we have observed prolonged respiratory insufficiency in several such infants. We reviewed the charts of 108 infants from 1975 to 1982 who had abdominal wall defects: 53 with gastroschisis, 29 with small omphaloceles, 22 with liver-containing or giant omphaloceles (GO), and four with cloacal exstrophy. Nine infants with GO (41%) had prolonged respiratory insufficiency and five died. Infants with GO required longer periods of oxygenation and ventilation (P less than .001, ANOVA) than infants with other abdominal wall defects. Clinical observation suggested that infants with GO have a small, narrow thorax. We obtained detailed measurements from the chest radiographs of infants in all groups. After correction for birth weight, babies with GO had smaller chest widths (P less than .001) and lung areas (P less than .05) than infants with other abdominal wall defects. At autopsy, one newborn with GO was found to have severe pulmonary hypoplasia. Prolonged respiratory insufficiency in infants with GO may be explained by pulmonary hypoplasia and/or by a narrow chest deformity which limits lung expansion.","respiratory failure, abdominal wall defect, omphalocele, gastroschisis"
This paper considers the problem of the determination of a harmonic function in a simply connected plane domain when the values of the function are known on some arcs of the boundary and the values of the normal derivative are known on the remaining boundary. We first present the solution in theoretical form and then show how to compute the solution with the aid of rapidly convergent series. The coefficients of these series are Fourier coefficients of certain functions and can be estimated by using the Fast Fourier Transform. The examples considered in the last part of the paper emphasize the advantages of the method presented in this paper for solving the mixed boundary-value problem as compared to other methods used for this purpose.,"Fourier, Fourier Transform, Fast Fourier Transform, Mathematical Method, Harmonic Function"
"Interactions with retail salespersons in stores contribute to building trust and profits. Within the largely impersonal Internet, an interactive animated character or avatar, playing the social role of an online sales assistant, should provide a potent source of social presence and so have the potential to replace some of these interactions. This investigation tests whether avatars with social- or task-oriented communication styles contribute to user trust and patronage intentions. Further tests explore the moderating effects of product/service type. The study includes an online experiment and survey, involving 636 participants, mainly from North America, Oceania and Europe, allocated randomly to different treatments. Task-oriented communications contribute to trust, which in turn contributes to patronage intentions, especially for search goods/services. Social-oriented communications also contribute directly to trust and to patronage intentions, most strongly for credence goods/services. The authors recommend a three-fold approach to avatar implementation, involving requirements captured to define appropriate appearance, role, interaction style and content for the task. Conclusions include further suggestions for development and research.","online experiment, trust, avatars, interaction style, internet shopping, communication style, profitability, credence good"
"Many small rodents living in the wild neither store food nor forage during the daytime. Thus they can feed only at night. Imposing this restriction upon young female laboratory mice maintained at 22 degrees C yields a dramatic daily cycle in their fat stores. Energy is rapidly stored as fat while feeding, and then rapidly utilized during the non-feeding period. Almost one-third of the extractable whole body fat is lost during a 14 hour non-feeding period. Less fat is stored while feeding at 11 degrees C. Thus missing a single feeding period at this cooler temperature results in a total depletion of fat stores. In an ultimate sense then, the daily challenge of surviving with such a paucity of fat reserves probably presents as great a problem to the small mammal as does the thermoregulatory cost of small body size itself. Strategies for solving this problem apparently vary immensely from population to population and from locale to locale.","Small Mammal, Cool Temperature, Daily Cycle, Store Food, Female Laboratory"
"All the information contained in a plain-text document are visible to everybody. On the other hand, compound documents using opaque formats, like Microsoft Compound Document File Format, may contain undisclosed data such as authors name, organizational information of users involved, previously deleted text, machine related information, and much more. Those information could be exploited by third party for illegal purposes. Computer users are unaware of the problem and, even though the Internet offers several tools to clean hidden data from documents, they are not widespread. Furthermore, there is only one paper about this problem in scientific literature, but there is no detailed analysis. In this paper we fill the gap, analyzing the problem with its causes and then we show how to take advantage of this issue: we show how hidden data may be extracted to gain evidence in forensic environment where even a small piece of information may be relevant and we also introduce a new stegosystem especially designed for Microsoft Office documents. We developed FTA, a tool to improve forensic analysis of Microsoft Office documents, and StegOle, another tool that implements a new stegosystem for Microsoft Office documents.

"Abeta peptides are naturally occurring peptides, which are thought to play a key role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD cases, levels of soluble and insoluble Abeta peptides increase in the brain as well as in the cerebrovasculature, a phenomenon that does not occur in extra-cranial vessels. There are frequently anomalies in the cerebrovasculature in AD, and despite increases in several pro-angiogenic factors in AD brain, evidence for increased vascularity is lacking; in fact there is evidence to the contrary. It has also been recently shown that Abeta peptides may have profound anti-angiogenic effects in vitro and in vivo. We therefore investigated whether there is evidence for altered angiogenesis in the vasculature in a transgenic mouse model of Abeta amyloidosis (Tg APPsw line 2576). In vitro, the formation of capillary-like structures on a reconstituted extracellular matrix by endothelial cells isolated from Tg APPsw is impaired. Ex vivo, the sprouting of new capillaries from arterial explants (over expressing Abeta) isolated from 9-month-old Tg APPsw is reduced compared to arterial explants isolated from control littermates. In addition, Tg APPsw mice show a reduction in vascular density in the cortex and hippocampus compared to control littermates. Altogether, our data suggest that the over expression of APPsw in the vasculature may oppose angiogenesis.","alzheimer, endothelial, angiogenesis, amyloid, endothelial cell, extracellular matrix, transgenic mouse"
"The friend mechanism is widely used in C++ software even though the potential benefits of its use are disputed and little is known about when, where and why it is employed in practice. Furthermore, there is limited empirical analysis of its impact in object-oriented software, with only one study (Counsell and Newson, 2000) reported at journal level. This paper aims to add to the empirical evidence of friendship's impact by replicating Counsell and Newson (2000)'s original study. The study's design is refined to improve the construct validity of the evaluation and a larger cohort of systems is used to improve the generalisability of the results. The findings suggest that classes involved in friendship are coupling hotspots and that there is no link between inheritance and friendship, contrary to the findings presented in Counsell and Newson (2000). The findings also suggest that the use of friends in a class is independent of the number of hidden members in a class.","empirical analysis, journal level, refined empirical study, coupling hotspots, original study, friend, empirical study, potential benefit, open-source, hidden member, larger cohort, object-oriented, c++, empirical evidence, object-oriented software, friend mechanism, object oriented, c, construct validity"
"One major aim in quantitative and translational neuroscience is to achieve a precise and fast neuronal counting method to work on high throughput scale to obtain reliable results. Here, we tested the isotropic fractionator (IF) method for evaluating neuronal and non-neuronal cell loss in different models of central nervous system (CNS) pathologies. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent: (i) ischemic brain damage; (ii) intraperitoneal injection with kainic acid (KA) to induce epileptic seizures; and (iii) monolateral striatal injection with quinolinic acid (QA) mimicking human Huntington's disease. All specimens were processed for IF method and cell loss assessed. Hippocampus from KA-treated rats and striatum from QA-treated rats were carefully dissected using a dissection microscope and a rat brain matrix. Ischemic rat brains slices were first processed for TTC staining and then for IF. In the ischemic group the cell loss corresponded to the neuronal loss suggesting that hypoxia primarily affects neurons. Combining IF with TTC staining we could correlate the volume of lesion to the neuronal loss; by IF, we could assess that neuronal loss also occurs contralaterally to the ischemic side. In the epileptic group we observed a reduction of neuronal cells in treated rats, but also evaluated the changes in the number of non-neuronal cells in response to the hippocampal damage. In the QA model, there was a robust reduction of neuronal cells on ipsilateral striatum. This neuronal cell loss was not related to a drastic change in the total number of cells, being overcome by the increase in non-neuronal cells, thus suggesting that excitotoxic damage in the striatum strongly activates inflammation and glial proliferation. We concluded that the IF method could represent a simple and reliable quantitative technique to evaluate the effects of experimental lesions mimicking human diseases, and to consider the neuroprotective/anti-inflammatory effects of different treatments in the whole brain and also in discrete regions of interest, with the potential to investigate non-neuronal alterations. Moreover, IF could be used in addition or in substitution to classical stereological techniques or TTC staining used so far, since it is fast, precise and easily combined with complex molecular analysis.","cerebral ischemia, epilepsy, isotropic fractionator, neuroprotection, striatal lesion"
"The integration of a monitoring port along the microfluidic path of a MALDI-chip integrated device is described. Optimization of the microreactor design allows longer reaction and measuring times. The Schiff base reaction between 4-tert-butylaniline (1) and 4-tert-butylbenzaldehyde (2) in ethanol was carried out on-chip in the MALDI ionization chamber and the formed imine 3 was detected in real time, demonstrating the feasibility of the ""monitoring window"" approach. This preliminary result opens the way to on-chip kinetic studies by MALDI-MS, by opening multiple monitoring windows along the microchannel.","chip, integrable system, ionization chamber, kinetics, real time"
"This article reports an analysis of the sources of variation in profitability and growth for manufacturing firms located in eleven European countries. A variance decomposition analysis determines the importance of the country, industry, corporate group and firm effects on profitability and growth. The analysis reveals evidence of differences between industries in the comparative advantage offered by different countries, reflecting a tendency for specialization and geographic concentration. However, as in several previous studies, the firm-level effects are the most important class of effect in explaining the variation in performance.","growth, profitability, industry and country effects, variance decomposition, firm, comparative advantage"
"The paper presents a complete set of direct strength equations for stainless steel members and sections in compression. The direct strength equations are based on recent research on the local, distortional and member bucking of stainless steel compression members, including the interaction of local and member buckling. The paper summarises the underlying research and presents the direct strength equations in a consistent format using a notation similar to that used in the North American Specification and the Australian Standard for (carbon) steel structures. Direct strength equations are proposed for local, distortional and combined local and member buckling, which fit within the framework of the Australian, North-American and European standards for stainless steel.","stainless steel structures, interaction buckling, member buckling, direct strength method, local buckling, stability, design, distortional buckling, structural stability"
"The onset of liquid entrainment during discharge from large reservoirs containing a stratified mixture of two immiscible fluids through a side slot of a finite width is considered theoretically. A previously reported analysis in which the slot was approximated as a two-dimensional line sink has been extended to account for the finite width of the slot. The model resulting from the present analysis is expressed in terms of two simple algebraic equations suitable for hand calculations. According to the present results, the ratio of the critical height to the slot width is dependent only on the Froude number. Numerical results show that the present model approaches the correct physical limits at low Froude numbers and it converges to the predictions of the previously reported simple model at high Froude numbers.","liquid entrainment, side slots, theoretical prediction, incipience"
"The case histories of 65 female schizophrenic patients were rated by means of the Phillips, Elgin, and Kantor scales. The reliability of the Phillips and Elgin scales was quite comparable and higher than that of the Kantor. The relationships among the various scales ranged from .52 to .82 for individual raters. However, differences among the scales were observed when ""normative"" scores were used and the scales appraised in terms of length of hospital stay and marital status. Although scores on all scales appeared to show some relationship to marital status, this relationship was not uniform among the scales. Marital status was also found to relate to length of hospitalization as well as any of the scales. (18 ref.)

"Entrusted with the records for more than 1.5 million patients, the Regenstrief Medical Record System (RMRS) has evolved into a fast and comprehensive data repository used extensively at three hospitals on the Indiana University Medical Center campus and more than 30 Indianapolis clinics. The RMRS routinely captures laboratory results, narrative reports, orders, medications. radiology reports, registration information, nursing assessments, vital signs, EKGs and other clinical data. In this paper, we describe the RMRS data model, file structures and architecture, as well as recent necessary changes to these as we coordinate a collaborative effort among all major Indianapolis hospital systems, improving patient care by capturing city-wide laboratory and encounter data. We believe that our success represents persistent efforts to build interfaces directly to multiple independent instruments and other data collection systems, using medical standards such as HL7, LOINC, and DICOM. Inpatient and outpatient order entry systems, instruments for visit notes and on-line questionnaires that replace hardcopy forms, and intelligent use of coded data entry supplement the RMRS. Physicians happily enter orders, problems, allergies, visit notes, and discharge summaries into our locally developed Gopher order entry system, as we provide them with convenient output forms, choice lists, defaults, templates, reminders, drug interaction information, charge information, and on-line articles and textbooks. To prepare for the future, we have begun wrapping our system in Web browser technology, testing voice dictation and understanding, and employing wireless technology.","medical records, emr, regenstrief medical record system, data capture, clinical data, drug interaction, data model, data collection"
"To design the ideal satellite formation configurations with an elliptic reference orbit, the characteristics of the relative motion are summarized from the precise equations in terms of the reference orbital elements. Several ideal formation orbits were produced with specific geometric features. Three ideal configurations were developed for three-satellite formations which can be used for remote sensing missions. The reference orbital elements approach is convenient for designing ideal formation orbits and configurations and can select the satellite initial states according to the formation features. The ideal formation design can be used to determine the natural formation design, which is more complicated but more useful due to perturbation effects and the formation initialization.","Formation configuration, Reference orbital element, Relative motion, Satellite formation flight"
"A prospective, case-controlled study was performed in 49 thalassemic children with severe hemolysis using real-time ultrasonographic (US) examination of the gallbladder and biliary system to detect gallstones, Seven children showed the presence of gallstones; 3 had undergone splenectomy before this study. Gallstones were found in 3 patients while admitted for elective splenectomy. The 14.3% incidence of gallstones in this group was significantly higher than in the control group. The children with gallstones also had significantly higher mean serum bilirubin levels, but their mean hemoglobin levels and mean intervals of blood transfusion were not significantly different from those thalassemic children with severe hemolysis who did not have gallstones. The proportion of gallstones also increased with age. US examination of the biliary tract is a simple, noninvasive technique and is practicable in children. This study indicates the need to screen for gallstones in high-risk groups of thalassemic children. Early detection of gallstones leads to correct management and better outcome, especially in splenectomized patients, who are more susceptible to infection.","gallstones, thalas- semia, chronic hemolysis, cholelithiasis"
"Clinicians, as well as embryologists, believe that normally a process of rotation of the midgut takes place that can be hampered at any stage resulting in the different types of ""malrotations."" However, a ""malrotated"" gut has never been observed in normal embryos. Therefore all theories on the normal and abnormal development of the gut are still highly hypothetical. In an attempt to elucidate more clearly which events occur during the development of the gut, the authors studied its embryology in 58 normal rat embryos between the 13th and 20th day of gestation using scanning electron microscopy. In 13 day old rat embryos, the midgut has already formed a loop. It can be subdivided into three parts: the central part with its connections to the stomach and leading to the straight part, with the colorectum on the left and the ""small bowel"" on the right, and the tip of the loop inside the umbilical cord. These three parts show no signs of developmental synchronization. Each part develops according to its own developmental blueprint: the duodenal and umbilical parts of the midgut show much developmental activity, whereas gross changes of the straight part of the midgut are not seen. This finding is surprising because a process of rotation, if occurring, should result in notable morphological changes especially in this region. Furthermore, the coecum never achieved a position in the upper left abdomen, as is often outlined in schematic drawings. After the return of the bowel into the abdominal cavity, the coecum lies exclusively on the right side of the midline close to the ventral abdominal wall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","rat embryology, malrotation, scanning electron microscopy, embryos"
"In this paper, receding horizon control of large-scale sewage systems is addressed considering different modelling approaches, which include several inherent continuous/ discrete phenomena (overflows in sewers and tanks) and elements (weirs) in the system. This fact results in distinct behaviours depending on the dynamic state (flow/volume) of the network. These behaviours can not be neglected nor can be modelled by a pure linear representation. In order to take into account these phenomena and elements for the design of the control strategy, a modelling approach based on piece-wise linear functions (PWLF) is proposed and compared against a hybrid modelling approach previously reported by the authors. Control performance results and associated computation times considering both modelling approaches are compared by using a real case study based on the Barcelona sewer network. Results have shown an important reduction in the computation time when the PWLF-based model is used, with an acceptable suboptimality level in the closed-loop system performance.","closed loop systems, control system synthesis, large-scale systems, modelling, piecewise linear techniques, sewage treatment, Barcelona sewer network, closed loop system performance, inherent continuous phenomena, inherent discrete phenomena, large scale sewage systems, modelling approaches, piecewise linear functions, receding horizon control design"
"Wireless sensor networks are constrained by limited battery energy. Thus, finite network lifetime is widely regarded as a fundamental performance bottleneck. Recent breakthrough in the area of wireless power transfer offers the potential of removing this performance bottleneck, i.e., allowing a sensor network to remain operational forever. In this paper, we investigate the operation of a sensor network under this new enabling energy transfer technology. We consider the scenario of a mobile charging vehicle periodically traveling inside the sensor network and charging each sensor node's battery wirelessly. We introduce the concept of renewable energy cycle and offer both necessary and sufficient conditions. We study an optimization problem, with the objective of maximizing the ratio of the wireless charging vehicle (WCV)'s vacation time over the cycle time. For this problem, we prove that the optimal traveling path for the WCV is the shortest Hamiltonian cycle and provide a number of important properties. Subsequently, we develop a near-optimal solution by a piecewise linear approximation technique and prove its performance guarantee.","Lifetime, optimization, wireless power transfer, wireless sensor network (WSN)"
"Efficient and fair use of buffer space in an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switch is essential to gain high throughput and low cell loss performance from the network. In this paper a shared buffer architecture associated with threshold-based virtual partition among output ports is proposed. Thresholds are updated based on traffic characteristics on each outgoing link, so as to adapt to traffic loads. The system behavior under varying traffic patterns is investigated via simulation; cell loss rate is the quality of service (QoS) measure used in this study. Our study shows that the threshold based dynamic buffer allocation scheme ensures a fair share of the buffer space even under bursty loading conditions.","ATM switch, Dynamic threshold updating, Cell loss, Quality of service"
"The number of fatigue assessments of composite bridges is growing rapidly worldwide due to increasing allowable load limits and because many of the bridges are reaching the end of their anticipated design life. Special attention is usually given to predicting the residual endurance or strength of the shear connection because it cannot be visually inspected. However, the increased stresses in the steel and concrete components due to partial interaction must also be considered in a fatigue assessment. Based on linear elastic partial interaction theory, this paper develops a simplified procedure to predict the partial interaction curvature in continuous composite beams. When used in conjunction with focal points, the partial interaction flexural stresses in the steel and concrete components can be determined and used to more accurately predict the residual strength or endurance of the composite section. This research extends the tiered assessment approach previously published for simply supported beams so that it is now applicable to composite beams with any number of spans, span lengths, shear connection distribution and cross-section. The technique is validated using a finite element program developed to model the behaviour of composite structures and the procedure is demonstrated in an illustrative assessment.","assessment, partial interaction, fatigue, slip, flexural stresses, curvature, continuous composite beams, finite element, cross section, visual inspection, linear elasticity, residual strength"
"The aim of this study was to determine the etiology, associated injuries, and outcome of children with pancreatic injuries.A retrospective review was conducted of children under 16 years with pancreatic trauma admitted to the Children's Hospital at Westmead (CHW) from January 1983 to September 2002. Deaths were reported to the New South Wales Paediatric Trauma Death Registry (State Registry) from January 1988 to September 2002.Sixty-five cases were identified: 46 patients were admitted to CHW, and 22 deaths were reported to the State Registry (including 3 deaths at CHW). The median age was 6 years (range, 1 to 14 years). Boys accounted for 60% (n = 40) of cases, decreasing to 50% (n = 11) of those that died. Motor vehicle injuries (MVI) were the most common mechanism, accounting for 40% of survivors and 77% of those who died. Children were restrained incorrectly in 48% of all cases and in 67% of those who died. Significantly more children who died had head, chest, and abdominal visceral injuries, compared with those who survived. Death occurred as a result of head injuries in 68%, with only 3 deaths directly attributed to pancreatico-duodenal injuries.Pancreatic injuries remain uncommon in children. The most frequent mechanism was MVI, with incorrect use of passenger restraints an important contributing factor. Whereas mortality was mainly caused by other injuries, 3 deaths were directly attributable to pancreato-duodenal trauma.","pancreatic injury, head injury, trauma, death, motor vehicle injury, human factors, occupational safety, ergonomics, suicide prevention, injury prevention"
"This paper uses a Bayesian network to model software reliability prediction with an operational profile. Due to the complexity of software products and development processes, software reliability models need to possess the ability to deal with multiple parameters. A Bayesian network exhibits a strong ability to adapt to problems involving complex variant factors. A special kind of Bayesian network named a Markov Bayesian network has been applied successfully into modeling software reliability prediction. However, the existing research did not pay enough attention to the fact that the failure characteristics of many software systems often depend on the specific operation performed. In this paper, an extended Markov Bayesian network is developed to model software reliability prediction with an operational profile. The extended Markov Bayesian network proposed in the paper is focused on discrete-time failure data. Methods to solve the network are proposed, and an example is used to illustrate the utilization of the model.","software system, bayesian network, operational profile, discrete-time failure data, software product, software reliability model, software reliability prediction, software reliability, software failure rate, extended markov bayesian network, software run, markov bayesian network, model software reliability prediction, discrete time, software systems, failure rate, development process"
"To explore placebo-controlled efficacy and safety of atomoxetine (ATX) for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).Children ages 5 to 15 with ASD and prominent ADHD symptoms were randomly assigned to order in a crossover of clinically titrated ATX and placebo, 6 weeks each, separated by 1-week washout. Slopes for each condition were compared by paired t test.In 2004-2005, 12 boys and 4 girls (7 with autistic disorder, 1 Asperger's, 8 pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified) all completed at least 3 weeks of each condition. On the primary outcome, the Hyperactivity subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, ATX was superior to placebo (p =.043, effect size d = 0.90). It was also superior on a 0 to 3 rating of nine DSM-IV ADHD hyperactive/impulsive symptoms (p =.005, d = 1.27), but missed significance on nine inattentive symptoms (p =.053, d= 0.89). Nine subjects responded to ATX, four to placebo (25% improvement on the Hyperactivity subscale plus Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement of 1-2. One was rehospitalized for recurrent violence on ATX. Adverse events were otherwise tolerable, with no tendency to stereotypy.ATX appears safe and effective for treating hyperactivity in some children with autism spectrum disorders. The effect appears as large as in a multisite methylphenidate trial in the same population, with fewer intolerable side effects. Further study in autism spectrum disorders is indicated.","autism, treatment, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, clinical trial, atomoxetine"
"Scalable data mining algorithms have become crucial to efficiently support KDD processes on large databases. In this paper, we address the task of scaling up k-medoid-based algorithms through the utilization of metric access methods, allowing clustering algorithms to be executed by database management systems in a fraction of the time usually required by the traditional approaches. We also present an optimization strategy that can be applied as an additional step of the proposed algorithm in order to achieve better clustering solutions. Experimental results based on several datasets, including synthetic and real ones, show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the number of distance calculations by a factor of more than three thousand times when compared to existing algorithms, while producing clusters of equivalent quality.","equivalent quality, k-medoid-based algorithm, scalable data mining algorithm, clustering solution, metric access method, database management system, additional step, distance calculation, clustering algorithm, proposed algorithm, access method"
"This study was conducted to evaluate early diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment outcome in children with pyomyositis.Between 2001 and 2006, 6 children with a mean age of 7.2 years were diagnosed and treated for pyomyositis in our clinic. The most common site of involvement was the hip and thigh region. All patients underwent early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination that played a significant role in the early diagnosis and management of the disease.Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen and was identified in 3 cases. Intravenous antibiotics were administered and were followed by oral agents for an additional period. The duration of therapy ranged from 3 to 6 weeks. No surgical intervention was needed. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate response to the therapy.Although pyomyositis is a rare disease, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of immediate onset of musculoskeletal pain in children. Early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment are important as major complications such as abscess formation and sepsis can be avoided. Having a high sensitivity to reactive inflammatory changes, MRI is a valuable tool in the armamentarium of the clinician in early diagnosis of pyomyositis.","pyomyositis, tropics, staphylococcus aureus, musculoskeletal infection, aetiology, magnetic resonance imaging, drug therapy, hips, antibiotics"
"Inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract has pronounced effects on GI function. Many of the functions of the GI tract are subject to neural regulation by the enteric nervous system (ENS) and its extrinsic connections. Therefore, it is possible that inflammatory effects on the ENS contribute to altered function during GI inflammation. The reflex circuitry of the ENS is comprised of sensory transducers in the mucosa (enteroendocrine cells), afferent neurons, interneurons and motor neurons. This review focuses on recent data that describe inflammation-induced changes to the ENS and mucosal enteroendocrine cells. Studies of tissues from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and from animal models of IBD have demonstrated marked changes in mucosal enteroendocrine cell signaling. These changes, which have been studied most intensely in 5-HT-containing enterochromaffin cells, involve changes in the number of cells, their signaling molecule content or their means of signal termination. Morphological evidence of enteric neuropathy during inflammation has been obtained from human samples and animal models of IBD. The neuropathy can reduce the number of enteric neurons in the inflamed region and is often accompanied by a change in the neurochemical coding of enteric neurons, both in the inflamed region and at distant sites. Electrophysiological recordings have been made from enteric neurons in inflamed regions of the colon of animal models of IBD. These studies have consistently found that inflammation increases excitability of intrinsic primary afferent neurons and alters synaptic transmission to interneurons and motor neurons. These data set the stage for a comprehensive examination of the role of altered neuronal and enteroendocrine cell signaling in symptom generation during GI inflammation.","enteroendocrine cell, immunohistochemistry, neurophysiology, inflammation, enteric nervous system, cell signaling, synaptic transmission"
"This article examines what factors increased social movements from the 1960s to the 1970s in advanced capitalist nations, by the Boolean algebra approach where the unit of analysis is a nation. The article verifies three powerful theories (political opportunity structure theory, relative deprivation theory, and resource mobilization theory) that describe the occurrence of the social movement of advanced capitalist nations. The analysis clearly shows the following: (1) each theory partially influenced the occurrence of social movement; and (2) the factors of social movement occurrence are not so different at each period of the protest cycle.","resource mobilization, social movement, political opportunity structure, relative deprivation, qca, unit of analysis, social movements, boolean algebra"
"A procedure has been described for the purification of the carcinoembryonic antigens (CEA) of the human digestive system. Tumor tissue extraction in 0.6 M perchloric acid followed by paper block electrophoresis and column chromatography on Sephadex G-200 resulted in highly purified CEA preparations as determined by both immunological and physicochemical criteria. The properties and composition of five different purified CEA preparations derived from digestive system cancer metastases were examined. The findings demonstrated a high degree of uniformity amongst these samples. Sedimentation coefficients ranged from 6.9 to 8S. Each sample showed the presence of 14 different amino acid residues and six different carbohydrate constituents (four of which could be quantitated with the amount of material available for analyis). Studies of a purified CEA preparation from a primary hepatoma yielded results which, in some respects, differed from those obtained with the CEA samples of metastatic tumor origin. The implications of these variations were discussed with regard to the probable presence of non-CEA components in the hepatoma preparation. Of primary importance was the observation that the few normal adult digestive system tissues tested failed to show the presence of constituents similar to the CEA. This finding would seem to indicate that, in the adult, the carcinoembryonic antigens of the human digestive system are qualitatively tumor-specific and are not dectectable in comparable normal tissues.","chromatography paper, antigens, amino acids, digestive system, ultracentrifugation"
Evolutionary spectral theory provides a means for defining a decomposition of signal energy jointly over time and frequency for processes which exhibit an oscillatory behavior. The oscillatory model of behavior effectively assumes that a process is composed sinusoidal components with slowly-varying time-dependent amplitudes. We expand evolutionary spectral theory by allowing the frequency of the sinusoidal components to vary with time. An estimator of this generalized spectrum is described and examples are presented that illustrate the relative merits of this new approach,"Fourier transforms, estimation theory, oscillations, spectral analysis, evolutionary spectral theory, generalised Fourier transformation, oscillatory behavior, oscillatory model, oscillatory processes, signal energy decomposition, sinusoidal components, slowly-varying time-dependent amplitudes, variable frequency evolutionary spectrum"
"Designers have been observed and their abilities and design processes were analysed. Their solutions were evaluated in order to measure the success. Success-promoting abilities were: good spatial imagination, routine in sketching, solid engineering knowledge and high heuristic competence. An appropriate strategic approach was found to be oriented towards the central function when solving simple problems, whereas in more complex problems the approach also conformed with methodical guidelines. All in all, a flexible methodical style of working proved successful. During the goal analysis successful tactics were: asking questions focused on the problem structure, summarizing information, and not suppressing solution ideas. During the search for solutions successful tactics were: varying alternatives at least for the main functions, generating and reducing variants in a balanced manner, and evaluating solutions frequently and according to their level of abstraction. Based on these findings, conclusions have been drawn for engineering design research, education and practice.","design tactic, design strategy, . design methodology, empirical investigation of design, design process, engineering design, design methodology"
"Summary Postobstructive diuresis occurs after relief of bilateral ureteral obstruction despite the persistent decrease in renal cortical perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). After an initial transient rise in renal blood flow (RBF) during acute ureteral obstruction, tubular damage and progressive vasoconstriction with decreased RBF, especially of medullary perfusion, are observed with chronic obstruction. These are associated with an activation of the renin-angiotensin system and of renal prostaglandin (PG) synthesis with enhanced production of the vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2. Azotemia and extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) expansion result from impaired renal function. Mechanisms of polyuria following relief from bilateral chronic obstruction include enhanced PGE-mediated medullary blood flow, structural and functional tubular damage with decreased sodium reabsorption and (vasopressin-resistent) impaired renal concentrating ability, osmotic diuresis, activation of natriuretic factors following ECFV-expansion, and sometimes iatrogenic excessive fluid replacement. The resulting loss of fluid and electrolytes represents a major hazard in patients after surgical correction of congenital or acquired urinary tract obstruction.","tubular function, prostaglandin- thromboxane system, renin-angiotensin system, renal haemodynamics, obstructive nephropathy- relief- po- lyuria, natriuretic factors zusammenfassung. eine postobstruktive polyurie, blood flow, urinary tract, renin angiotensin system, glomerular filtration rate, extracellular fluid volume, renal blood flow, renal function"
"It was predicted that advanced, average, and retarded readers would also be advanced, average, and retarded in both the number of trials required to master symbolic learning tasks and in their response latencies to visual and auditory symbols. Some confirmation of the prediction was obtained, but both the provision of a reward and the effect of practice increased the efficiency of retarded readers, especially on the auditory task. The data were interpreted as suggesting that retarded readers need an incentive in relatively difficult learning situations and also that, unless highly motivated, retarded readers tend to be less attentive to stimuli. It was further suggested that difficulties in symbolic learning may be, in part, a function of reduced ability to attend to stimuli.

"Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 4 (PEBP4), a member of the PEBP family, plays a pivotal role in tumor progression. However, the roles of PEBP4 in breast cancer remain unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the effects of PEBP4 on breast cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and the underlying mechanism was also explored. Our results showed that the expression of PEBP4 was significantly up-regulated in breast cancer cell lines. Knockdown of PEBP4 inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, knockdown of PEBP4 suppressed breast cancer cell migration and invasion with prevented EMT. Mechanistically, knockdown of PEBP4 inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation and migration through the inactivation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated for the first time that knockdown of PEBP4 inhibited the proliferation, invasion and tumorigenesis in breast cancer cells. Thus, PEBP4 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer.","Breast cancer, Invasion, PEBP4, PI3K/Akt pathway, Proliferation"
"A retrospective review was performed of the records of 93 children with urinary tract calculi treated during a 10-year period (1983 to 1992). Two distinct groups of patients were identified. One group comprised 63 Aboriginal children, mainly from the northern region of Western Australia, who presented at a young age (average, 2.8 years) with urinary tract infections and failure to thrive. The other group comprised of 30 non-Aboriginal children, mainly from the metropolitan region, who presented at an older age (average, 6.7 years) with abdominal and flank pain. Calculi were located in the upper urinary tract in 85 children (91.4%) and in the bladder in eight (8.6%). Most patients underwent open surgical procedures for removal of their calculi, and the overall success rate was 86%. In recent years, percutaneous nephrolithotomy has been used successfully in selected patients with renal pelvic calculi. This method seems to be the trend for the future.","pediatric, urinary, calculi, urinary tract"
"U-section steel sheet piles are commonly used for constructing retaining walls in marine environments and have been in widespread use throughout the world for most of the 20th century. Relatively recently, concern has been raised about the bending strength of this pile section, because U-section piles are connected together by interlocking joints located along the pile wall centreline. As the piles resist bending moments, inter-pile movement can significantly increase bending stresses. When this occurs, the wall is said to have exhibited reduced modulus action (RMA), reducing the bending strength and stiffness below the fully composite values normally assumed during design. In view of this concern, the recently introduced Eurocode 3: Part 5 has introduced strength reduction factors to account for the effect of RMA during design. The work presented herein has been carried out in order to provide more information as to the values that should be selected for these reduction factors. The work is based on the experimental testing of one-eighth-scale miniature piles.","steel structures, reduced modulus action, retaining walls, codes of practice and standards, u-section piling, piles and piling, substructures, bending strength"
"Results and discussion The care programs and the planning tool were not compatible and did not achieve the intended goals. The professionals failed to appreciate flexibility of the care programs. The implementation of the planning tool failed because of too little user involvement in the implementation. Moreover, care programs were in general not accepted by the professionals. All this resulted in a non-fit between the care programs and the planning tool. We advise for routine processes as care programs to develop a balance between flexibility and standardization. This is a process of trial and error and requires adaptive information technology and user involvement in development and implementation.","management information systems, implementation, health care, technology, management information system"
"To examine ratings and objective measures of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms to assess whether ADHD children with and without comorbid conditions have equally high levels of core symptoms and whether symptom profiles differ as a function of comorbidity and gender.Four hundred ninety-eight children from the NIMH Collaborative Multisite Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA) were divided into comorbid groups based on the parent Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children and assessed via parents' and teachers' Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham (SNAP) ratings and a continuous performance test (CPT). Comorbidity and gender effects were examined using analyses of covariance controlled for age and site.CPT inattention, impulsivity, and dyscontrol errors were high in all ADHD groups. Children with ADHD + oppositional defiant or conduct disorder were rated as more impulsive than inattentive, while children with ADHD + anxiety disorders (ANX) were relatively more inattentive than impulsive. Girls were less impaired than boys on most ratings and several CPT indices, particularly impulsivity, and girls with ADHD + ANX made fewer CPT impulsivity errors than girls with ADHD-only.Children with ADHD have high levels of core symptoms as measured by rating scales and CPT, irrespective of comorbidity. However, there are important differences in symptomatology as a function of comorbidity and gender.","impulsivity, comorbidity, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, gender"
"Aliasing is crucial for supporting useful implementation patterns, but it makes reasoning about programs difficult. To deal with this problem, numerous type-based aliasing control mechanisms have been proposed, expressing properties such as uniqueness. Uniqueness, however, is black-and-white: either a reference is unique or it can be arbitrarily aliased; and global: excluding aliases throughout the entire system, making code brittle to changing requirements. Disjointness domains, a new approach to alias control, address this problem by enabling more graduations between uniqueness and arbitrary reference sharing. They allow expressing aliasing constraints local to a certain set of variables (either stack variables or fields) for instance that no aliasing occurs between variables within some set of variables but between such sets or the opposite, that aliasing occurs within that set but not between different sets. A hierarchy of disjointness domains controls the flow of references through a program, helping the programmer reason about disjointness and enforce local alias invariants. The resulting system supports fine-grained control of aliasing between both variables and objects, making aliasing explicit to programmers, compilers, and tooling. This paper presents a formal account of disjointness domains along with examples. Disjointness domains provide novel means of expressing may-alias kinds of constraints, which may prove useful in compiler optimisation and verification.","Aliasing, linear types, mutable state, type systems, uniqueness"

Because prenatal diagnosis is difficult to achieve and current guidelines for neonatal resuscitation do not provide any recommendation, the resuscitative team may not be prepared for managing such a case. Usefulness of uncommon resuscitative maneuvers is discussed: a promptly performed surgical tracheotomy is the only mean to ventilate such a baby.","newborn, resuscitation, tracheal agenesis, genetics"
"CrMoN composite coatings were deposited on the surface of the stainless steel by magnetron sputtering, then were treated by low temperature ion sulfuration. FESEM equipped with EDX was adopted to analyze the morphologies and compositions of the surface, cross-section and worn scar of the sulfuration layer. The valence states of the film surface were detected by XPS. The nano-hardness and nano-modulus of the layer were measured by a nano tester. The results of the friction and wear show that the CrMoN/MoS2 composite coating is a kind of ideal solid lubrication layer and possess an excellent antifriction and wear-resistance.","CrMoN/MoS2, Low temperature ion sulfurizing, Magnetron sputtering, Solid lubrication"
"Expert judgment-based effort estimation of software development work is partly based on non-mechanical and unconscious processes. For this reason, a certain degree of intra-person inconsistency is expected, i.e., the same information presented to the same individual at different occasions sometimes lead to different effort estimates. In this paper, we report from an experiment where seven experienced software professionals estimated the same sixty software development tasks over a period of three months. Six of the sixty tasks were estimated twice. We found a high degree of inconsistency in the software professionals' effort estimates. The mean difference of the effort estimates of the same task by the same estimator was as much as 71%. The correlation between the corresponding estimates was 0.7. Highly inconsistent effort estimates will, on average, be inaccurate and difficult to learn from. It is consequently important to focus estimation process improvement on consistency issues and thereby contribute to reduced budget-overruns, improved time-to-market, and better quality software.","effort estimate, inconsistent effort estimate, experienced software professional, software professional, different effort estimate, software development, software development work, better quality software, expert judgment-based estimate, inconsistency, expert judgment, sixty software development task, certain degree, effort estimation, software development effort, expert judgment-based effort estimation"
"Despite the popularity of (graphical) notations for the specification of object behaviour, there is no common understanding of what exactly constitutes the life cycle of an object. Consequently, different frameworks for the object-oriented modeling of systems allow for the specification of different kinds of behaviour. Unfortunately, the semantics of languages used in this area is often not clearly stated. In addition to the problems arising from this lack of formality, inheritance of behaviour is usually not covered by commonly used object-oriented languages. Therefore, flawless systems are difficult to build, because unpleasant surprises most easily occur if an object of a subclass is used in the context of its superclass. In the light of these problems this article states requirements for languages in the area of modeling and inheritance of object behaviour, surveys existing proposals, and introduces a novel approach.","article states requirement, systems modeling, object behaviour, object-oriented system, object-oriented language, flawless system, common understanding, novel approach, dynamic models, life cycle, inheritance, object-orientation, different kind, object-oriented modeling, petri-nets, different framework, concurrency, object life cycles, object orientation, petri nets, petri net, system modeling, object oriented language, object oriented"
"Few population-based cancer registries are in place in developing countries. In order to know the burden of cancer in Moroccan population, cancer registry initiative was put in place in the Casablanca district, the biggest city of Morocco.The data collected covers 3.6 millions inhabitant and included Casablanca city and the administrative region.The data collected in the years 2005-07 show that the top 5 forms of cancers in women were breast (ASR: 36.4 per 100,000), cervical (15.0), thyroid (6.7), colon-rectum (5.8), and ovarian (5.3); the top 5 cancers in men were lung (25.9), prostate (13.5), bladder (8.7), colon-rectum (8.1) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (7.2). Tumours of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues represented 11% of all cancers (skin excluded); some presented unusual sex ratios. For breast, cervical, colorectal and thyroid cancer, respectively 57%, 42%, 28% and 60% of the cases were under 50 years of age. This was attributable to particularly low numbers of cases recorded among old people, and the young age of the general population; the observed age-specific incidences under age 50 were not higher than in western countries. Cancers at young ages were particularly common in women: 67% of the cases were under 50. Stage at diagnosis could be obtained for 82% of the breast cancer cases and was as follows: 28% local, 63% regional and 9% distant, in the absence of screening.These first population-based data have provided an invaluable resource for the national cancer control plan of Morocco, and will be useful tool to its future evaluation.","casablanca, morocco, population-based cancer registry, cancer incidence, incidence, young adult"
"Babesia caballi caused pathological changes in the vector tick, Anocentor nitents . These included the loss of hemocytes, reddish-brown discoloration of the hemolymph, retardation in clotting, and reduction in egg production. Primary cultures were initiated from A. nitens embryos transovarially infected with B. caballi . Cell lines that were isolated were morphologically similar and composed of stellate, fusiform, and hemocyte-like cells, but none was visibly infected with B. caballi . Primary cultures from heavily infected ticks were not viable and did not develop into lines. Kinetes from hemolymph and organs of A. nitens were cocultivated with cell lines isolated from embryos of A. nitens, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus , and Rhipicephalus sanguineus . They attached to and actively penetrated the cells. Cells that were penetrated by or infected with B. caballi showed rounding off, degeneration, and lysis. In Giemsa-stained spreads prepared after 1 or 2 days in vitro, more kinetes were associated with R. appendiculatus cells when the medium contained A. nitens egg extract (TEE). Ninety percent of the B. caballi kinetes were always found within or in close contact with cells from A. nitens , cultured with or without TEE. The parasites were club shaped, amoeboid, or round. Intracellular Babesia were frequently lying adjacent to the host cell nucleus. In the cultures the parasites were detected by light microscopy for 3 to 5 days; they did not transform into other tick-associated stages and were not seen after 1 week. This is the first report of the cultivation of tick stages of B. caballi in tick cell cultures.","anocentor nitens, ticks, pathogenicity of, babesia caballi, kinetes, tick cell culture, rhipicephalus sanguineus, rhipicephalus appendiculatus"
"There is ongoing debate regarding the impact of youth behavior problems on placement change in child welfare compared to the impact of placement change on behavior problems. Existing studies provide support for both perspectives. The purpose of this study was to prospectively examine the relations of behavior problems and placement change in a nationally representative sample of youths in the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being.The sample consisted of 500 youths in the child welfare system with out-of-home placements over the course of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being study. We used a prospective cross-lag design and path analysis to examine reciprocal effects of behavior problems and placement change, testing an overall model and models examining effects of age and gender.In the overall model, out of a total of eight path coefficients, behavior problems significantly predicted placement changes for three paths and placement change predicted behavior problems for one path. Internalizing and externalizing behavior problems at baseline predicted placement change between baseline and 18 months. Behavior problems at an older age and externalizing behavior at 18 months appear to confer an increased risk of placement change. Of note, among female subjects, placement changes later in the study predicted subsequent internalizing and externalizing behavior problems.In keeping with recommendations from a number of professional bodies, we suggest that initial and ongoing screening for internalizing and externalizing behavior problems be instituted as part of standard practice for youths entering or transitioning in the child welfare system.","child, adolescent, mental health, placement change, child welfare, prospective study"
"Nowadays, aquaculture industry still confronts several disease-related problems mainly caused by viruses, bacteria and parasites. In the last decade, the use of mannan oligosaccharides (MOS) in fish production has received increased attention due to its beneficial effects on fish performance and disease resistance. This review shows the MOS use in aquaculture with a specific emphasis on the effectiveness of the several MOS forms available in the market related to disease resistance, fish nutrition and the possible mechanisms involved. Among the main beneficial effects attributed to MOS dietary supplementation, enhanced fish performance, feed efficiency and pathogen protection by potentiation of the systemic and local immune system and the reinforcement of the epithelial barrier structure and functionality are some of the most commonly demonstrated benefits. These combined effects suggest that the reinforcement of the intestinal integrity and functionality, together with the stimulation of the innate immune system, are the primary mode of action of MOS in fish. However, the supplementation strategy related to the structure of the MOS added, the correct dose and duration, as well as fish species, size and culture conditions are determinant factors to achieve improvements in health status and growth performance.","bacterial disease outbreak, gut associated lymphoid tissue (galt), gut integrity, innate immune system, mannan oligosaccharides"
Rock bolts of steel are the most frequently used components in systems for rock reinforcement. Special types are used as energy absorbing elements in systems exposed to dynamic loads and these must yield plastically under high loading velocities. A new type of energy absorbing rock bolt of soft steel has been suggested and tested. To investigate the strain rate effects on the yield stress and ultimate strength of the steel were bars dynamically loaded in a high speed testing machine. The observed tensile forces can be divided into one part from impact and another from quasi-static straining. The tests showed that there was a considerable strain rate effect on the yield stress of the steel. It is recommended that higher dynamic yield stresses are utilized in the dynamic design which has to incorporate the risk of high peak forces from impact loading.,"dynamic testing, strain rate effect, energy absorbing, rock bolt, yield stress"
"Mobile shopping is increasing in prevalence and has become a necessary part of many people's daily lives. However, one main channel for mobile shopping, mobile shopping applications (apps), has not been thoroughly investigated. This study focused on mobile text advertising delivered from mobile shopping apps using the intention to purchase as the dependent variable for testing its marketing effect. In the context of a promotion focus vs. a prevention focus, we used Higgins' regulatory focus theory combined with Ajzen's TPB and Herzog's U&G to analyze the mechanism by which consumers formulate an intention to purchase in a mobile advertising context. This empirical study surveyed 320 consumers who had made a purchase using a mobile shopping app in the previous month. The results showed that infotainment, irritation, and subjective norms were significantly associated with attitudes; in turn, attitudes mediated the impact of these three factors on the intention to purchase. Moreover, a high promotion focus not only strengthened the positive effect of infotainment on attitudes but also intensified the mediation effect of attitudes between infotainment and the intention to purchase. A high prevention focus also consolidated the negative effect of irritation on attitudes as well as reinforced the mediation effect of attitudes between irritation and the intention to purchase. Furthermore, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control collectively impacted the intention to purchase. These findings shed light on ways to customize goods information in mobile advertising and have strong theoretical and practical implications.","attitudes, infotainment, intention to purchase, irritation, mobile text advertising, regulatory focus"
"This paper presented the vertical mass flux profiles of different grain size groups in aeolian sand transport, which is the hot issue of non-uniform sand transport research but is rarely studied recently. The sand samples of vertical mass flux were further investigated using a particle size analyzer that were measured in a wind tunnel experiment conducting with non-uniform sands and five different stream velocities. Results show that the vertical mass flux profiles of coarse sand groups are similar to that of all sands measured in the wind tunnel, exhibiting an exponential decay distribution with a positive deviation occurring in the near-bed region; however, the vertical mass flux profiles of fine sand groups decayed exponentially in the whole height. Based on the results above, this study simulated the vertical mass flux profiles of different grain size groups in terms of equilibrium saltation theory. It is revealed that in the non-uniform sand transport, the launch speed and angle distributions of coarse sand are exponential function; the launch speed of fine sand is exponential function but the launch angle of it is Gaussian function. The mean sand launch speed occur between 0.4u* and 2.2u*, decaying with the increase of wind speed (u*) and grain size.","Aeolian sand transport, Mass fux profiles of different sized sand, Model simulation, Particle size analysis"
"A method for the analysis of rainwater ponding on flat or nearly flat one-way and two-way roofs, published in 2007, is modified. The existing method appears accurate for roofs of continuous secondary members and profiled steel sheeting, but is far too pessimistic for roofs in which all composing parts are simply-supported. After summarizing the formerly published method, a modification is proposed in order to fit better with FEM-packages, considered in this context to be exact solutions. In essence, the stored water in the deflected secondary members and steel sheeting elements is estimated more properly. An easy way has been found how to adapt the existing spring-piston model in order to better account for the correct volume of accumulated water in the secondary members and profiled steel sheeting. An application example and discussion of the results complete the article.","simply-supported roofs, method of analysis, design method, rainwater ponding, flat roof collapse, exact solution"
"Although prior studies suggest that technology competencies play a significant role in firm innovation and competitiveness, what and how technology competencies interacted with competitive environment affect firm innovation has not been fully understood. This paper fills this research gap through a questionnaire survey of 165 firms together with a number of interviews drawn from the Taiwan's information and communication technology (ICT) industry. The results suggest that capabilities of exploring or exploiting technological opportunities, core technology capability, and autonomy of R&D decisions are particularly important to firm innovation in a highly competitive environment, whereas over commitments to existing technologies may constrain a firm's innovation especially in such environment. Moreover, different types of competitive environment require different types of technological competencies to enhance firm innovativeness. This paper contributes to the existing theory by examining the joint effect of technology competency and competitive environment on a firm's innovation.","competitive environment, innovation, technology capability, dynamic capability, questionnaire survey, information and communication technology"
"In this paper we report on results from experiments performed on a bi-modal piezoelectric transducer used both as an active ultrasound transceiver and a passive acoustic sensor. The transducer, which has a low Q factor in order to exhibit a sufficiently broad bandwidth, will be integrated into a wearable system. In particular, it is placed, along with ECG fabric electrodes, within a textile belt wrapped around the chest. The transducer behaves as an acoustic sensor at low frequency and as an ultrasound transducer at high frequency. The low-frequency acoustic signals were compared with the analogue signals acquired simultaneously by commercial biomedical sensors. These signals provide information about the respiratory activity and heart apex pulse. A comparative analysis was performed both in the time and frequency domain and results were discussed. Moreover, the same transducer used at high frequencies is able to generate ultrasound signals which can bounce off the target organ, the heart, and receive the back-propagated echoes. The experimental validation was done by means of a comparison between the spatial interval inferred from time delay of the return echoes detected by the transducer and the actual distance from the target. This information, in addition to ECG signals, can provide helpful cues for the cardiac status of the subject, both in terms of prevention and diagnosis.","frequency domain, heart, low frequency, back propagation, ultrasonic transducers, frequency domain analysis, q factor, ultrasound, high frequency, comparative analysis"
"This paper presents the first behavioral model solution to the computationally efficient simulation of digital I/O buffers under overclocking operation. Our physics-based two-port approach relies on predicting the timing signals that control the activation of the driver's output stage. The identified nonlinear dynamic model operators of the input port replace the concatenated fixed step-input describing functions of the previous table-based I/O buffer information specification and of other parametric approaches. The implemented gray-box model produces more accurate results than the previous methodologies when assessing the signal integrity performance of high-speed digital links in normal and overclocking conditions under various input excitations. However, it still preserves the computational efficiency recognized for its behavioral model predecessors.","buffer circuits, digital integrated circuits, i/o buffer overclocking simulation, concatenated fixed step-input, gray-box model, nonlinear dynamic model operators, two-port behavioral model, digital output buffers/drivers, nonlinear system identification, signal integrity, table-based behavioral modeling, transient analysis"
"An incompressible potential flow theory is used to determine the steady separated flow about an aerofoil. The theory permits a continuous variation from fully-attached (Joukowski) flow to fully-separated (Helmholtz) flow, with the Kutta condition always satisfied at the trailing edge, and with the position of the separation point as an assignable parameter to determine the flow configuration. The method is also applicable to other flows such as that about a flat plate with a rear free-stream flap.","potential flow, flow separation, inviscid flow, potential theory, airfoils, attachment, satisfiability, incompressible flow"
"Manual chemical data curation from publications is error-prone, time consuming, and hard to maintain up-to-date data sets. Automatic information extraction can be used as a tool to reduce these problems. Since chemical structures usually described in images, information extraction needs to combine structure image recognition and text mining together.We have developed ChemEx, a chemical information extraction system. ChemEx processes both text and images in publications. Text annotator is able to extract compound, organism, and assay entities from text content while structure image recognition enables translation of chemical raster images to machine readable format. A user can view annotated text along with summarized information of compounds, organism that produces those compounds, and assay tests.ChemEx facilitates and speeds up chemical data curation by extracting compounds, organisms, and assays from a large collection of publications.

"Convolutional neural networks have recently demonstrated high-quality reconstruction for single image super-resolution. However, existing methods often require a large number of network parameters and entail heavy computational loads at runtime for generating high-accuracy super-resolution results. In this paper, we propose the deep Laplacian Pyramid Super-Resolution Network for fast and accurate image super-resolution. The proposed network progressively reconstructs the sub-band residuals of high-resolution images at multiple pyramid levels. In contrast to existing methods that involve the bicubic interpolation for pre-processing (which results in large feature maps), the proposed method directly extracts features from the low-resolution input space and thereby entails low computational loads. We train the proposed network with deep supervision using the robust Charbonnier loss functions and achieve high-quality image reconstruction. Furthermore, we utilize the recursive layers to share parameters across as well as within pyramid levels, and thus drastically reduce the number of parameters. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of run-time and image quality.","Image reconstruction, Feature extraction, Convolution, Spatial resolution, Laplace equations, Interpolation"
"This article presents Quo Vadis, an evolving framework for intelligent traffic management in very large communication networks. Quo Vadis is designed to exploit topological properties of large networks as well as their spatio-temporal dynamics to optimize multiple performance criteria through cooperation among nodes in the network. It employs a distributed representation of network state information using local load measurements supplemented by a less precise global summary. Routing decisions in Quo Vadis are based on parameterized heuristics designed to optimize various performance metrics in an anticipatory or proactive, as well as compensatory or reactive mode, and to minimize the overhead associated with traffic management. The results of simulation experiments within a grid network clearly demonstrate the ability of Quo Vadis to avoid congestion and minimize message delay under a variety of network load conditions.","quo vadis, intelligent routing, large communication network, simulation experiment, traffic management, computer science"
"To establish the prevalence of sexually transmitted organisms and other genital organisms in potentially sexually abused children.Prospective study of children attending an inner London department of community paediatrics for evaluation of possible sexual abuse.Children under 16 referred for evaluation of possible sexual abuse.Prevalence of sexually transmitted organisms in relation to age, symptoms, and type of abuse.Swabs were taken from 159 of 242 girls evaluated. The overall prevalence of sexually transmitted organisms was 3.7%: three girls were infected with gonorrhoea, four with Trichomonas vaginalis, and two with Chlamydia trachomatis. One girl had all three infections plus mycoplasmas. Mycoplasmas were identified in 22% of girls swabbed. Of 30 boys swabbed, none yielded a sexually transmitted organism.There is a low prevalence of definitely sexually transmitted organisms in children who might have been abused. Other organisms possibly associated with sexual activity can be identified in this population. Screening for infection should be mandatory in presumed sexually abused girls with vaginal discharge and ideally should be undertaken in all children attending for evaluation of sexual abuse.","prevalence, suicide prevention, occupational safety, human factors, ergonomics, injury prevention"
"In this paper we present a formal language for specifying and reasoning about cryptographic protocol requirements. We give sets of requirements for key distribution protocols and for key agreement protocols in that language. We look at a key agreement protocol due to Aziz and Diffie that might meet those requirements and show how to specify it in the language of the NRL Protocol Analyzer. We also show how to map our formal requirements to the language of the NRL Protocol Analyzer and use the Analyzer to show that the protocol meets those requirements. In other words, we use the Analyzer to assess the validity of the formulae that make up the requirements in models of the protocol. Our analysis reveals an implicit assumption about implementations of the protocol and reveals subtleties in the kinds of requirements one might specify for similar protocols.","Data Structure, Information Theory, Discrete Geometry, Formal Language, Implicit Assumption"
"Extra-intestinal nematodes of companion animals are of growing concern in veterinary medicine for their pathogenic potential and the current expansion throughout Europe. The present study has evaluated the occurrence of major canine and feline extra-intestinal nematodes in regions of Italy having epidemiological relevance. Associations of various recorded parameters related to the examined animals have been statistically evaluated, along with a comparative analysis with the most recent epidemiological data. Overall, 1055 dogs and 1000 cats were tested. Among extra-intestinal nematodes Angiostrongylus vasorum was the most common in dogs followed by Capillaria aerophila and Dirofilaria spp.; Aelurostrongylus abstrusus was the most recorded parasite in cats, followed by C. aerophila and Troglostrongylus brevior. The statistical analysis revealed that outdoor access is associated with A. vasorum, A. abstrusus and T. brevior infections, that were also more prevalent in animals with cardio-respiratory signs. Moreover, cats aged less than 12 months had more chances to be infected by lungworms. The data herein presented confirm the occurrence and the possible risk of expansion of different extra-intestinal parasitoses of dogs and cats in Italy, underlining the importance of a constant epidemiologic vigilance and of appropriate control methods.","Italy, epidemiology, extra-intestinal nematodes, pets"

"The superiority of depleted uranium on tungsten-alloy penetrators has recently been assigned to the self-sharpening mechanism, at the tip of the DU rods, due to the adiabatic shear failure which this material experiences. The purpose of the work presented here was to further investigate the role of deformed nose profile on the deep penetrations of long rods into semi-infinite targets. This was achieved through a series of 2-D numerical simulations and several perforation experiments where we recovered and examined the residual penetrators. The simulations were performed for rigid tungsten-alloy rods having five different nose shapes with the density and elastic properties of tungsten alloys. For the normal impact experiments we chose three rod materials: a tungsten alloy, a copper and a titanium alloy. The residual rods (after perforation of finite thickness targets) were imaged by flash X-ray and softly recovered using sand boxes. As expected, the nose shapes of these rods were very different from each other.","numerical simulation, depleted uranium, titanium alloy, copper"
The dispersion relationship describing the propagation of electromagnetic (EM) surface modes supported by a ferrite slab of finite thickness magnetized parallel to the planes of its air-ferrite-air or air-ferrite-metal interfaces is investigated.

"The use of alternative poly(A) sites is common and affects the post-transcriptional fate of mRNA, including its stability, subcellular localization and translation. Here, we present a method to identify poly(A) sites in a genome-wide and strand-specific manner. This method, termed 3'T-fill, initially fills in the poly(A) stretch with unlabeled dTTPs, allowing sequencing to start directly after the poly(A) tail into the 3'-untranslated regions (UTR). Our comparative analysis demonstrates that it outperforms existing protocols in quality and throughput and accurately quantifies RNA levels as only one read is produced from each transcript. We use this method to characterize the diversity of polyadenylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, showing that alternative RNA molecules are present even in a genetically identical cell population. Finally, we observe that overlap of convergent 3'-UTRs is frequent but sharply limited by coding regions, suggesting factors that restrict compression of the yeast genome.","polyadenylation, transcriptome, gene expression profiling, biomedical research, bioinformatics"
"Providing reliable services is one of the primary goals in designing a distributed operating system. Nowadays, we have seen a trend in distributed operating system design to shift from large kernel architectures or even monolithic architectures to microkernel architectures supported by the client/server model. This means that a lot of services of an operating system originally provided by the monolithic kernel are moved out of the kernel, forming individual servers. It is then crucial to guarantee that these servers will provide reliable services. This article describes a design, based on a twin-servers model, of fault-tolerant servers for the microkernel-based RHODOS distributed operating system. A model that supports fault-tolerant services is designed. The performance of the model is simulated and analyzed. A design that implements the model in the RHODOS environment is also outlined.","fault-tolerant server, rhodos system, fault tolerant, operating system, client server"
"Background/Purpose: The T-tube ileostomy was first used at Texas Children's Hospital in 1959. The purpose of this study is to update the experience since the initial report of this technique in 1981. Methods: A database of 448 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) seen in the authors' institution was used to identify 83 patients (18.5%) who presented with meconium ileus. The clinic and hospital charts of these patients were reviewed retrospectively to identify patients who had undergone placement of a T-tube ileostomy. Results: Surgery was performed in 60 of 83 patients for complications of meconium ileus or failure to evacuate the meconium after a contrast enema. Of these patients, 21 of 60 (35%) underwent placement of a T-tube ileostomy. An additional 8 patients were identified who underwent placement of a T-tube ileostomy but were not included in the CF database, for a total of 29 patients who have been treated with T-tube ileostomy since 1959 at Texas Children's Hospital. Five patients were excluded from analysis because of insufficient data or misdiagnosis. One of the 24 patients in the series died of complications of prematurity. A total of 20 of 23 patients had resolution of their meconium ileus after T-tube irrigation with n -acetylcysteine or pancreatic enzymes. Three patients required additional surgery to relieve persistent bowel obstruction. All patients had the T -tube removed within the first 8 weeks after surgery. Two patients required subsequent repair of an incisional hernia. There were otherwise no complications of this procedure, with an average follow-up of 11.5 years. Conclusion: In patients with uncomplicated meconium ileus unrelieved by contrast enema, the Ttube ileostomy is an effective and safe treatment.","cystic fibrosis, meconium ileus, ileostomy, t-tube, enzyme"
"Injectable delivery systems are attractive as vehicles for localized delivery of therapeutics especially in the context of regenerative medicine. In this study, photocrosslinked polyanhydride (PA) networks were modified by incorporation of microparticles to modulate long-term delivery of macromolecules. The in vitro release of two model proteins (horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and bovine serum albumin labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC-BSA)) were evaluated from networks composed of sebacic acid dimethacrylate (MSA), 1,6-bis-carboxyphenoxyhexane dimethacrylate (MCPH), poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), and calcium carbonate (CaCO3), supplemented with gelatin microparticles or sodium chloride crystals. Prior to incorporation into the networks, proteins were formulated into granules by dilution with a cyclodextrin excipient and gelatin-based wet-granulation. Protein release was modulated by incorporation of microparticles into photocrosslinked PA networks, presumably by enabling aqueous channels through the matrix. Furthermore, a dual release system has been demonstrated by incorporation of protein in both the PA matrix and the gelatin microparticles. These results suggest that microparticle incorporation into the photocrosslinked PA system may be a useful strategy to modulate protein release in injectable delivery systems for the long-term delivery of macromolecules. These composites present an interesting class of materials for bone regeneration applications.","polyanhydrides, bone augmentation, cyclodextrin, controlled dual release"

"This study assessed the influence of gender on the comparability of self and observer ratings of anxiety and depression in adolescents.Subjects were 75 inpatient adolescents who were administered structured interviews of the revised Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression (HRSD-R) and Anxiety (HARS-R) and read the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).All measures demonstrated adequate internal consistency and validity. The correlation between the BDI and HRSD-R was significantly higher for females than males; of 11 symptoms that overlap on the BDI and HRSD-R, observers significantly agreed with males and females in their perceptions of 5 and 11 depressive symptoms, respectively. The correlation between the BAI and HARS-R did not differ significantly for males and females.Results suggest that self-reports of anxiety symptoms are a valid, cost-effective alternative to anxiety observer ratings for boys and girls' self-reports of depression are comparable to depression ratings by observers. There is the need to collect self-report information from adolescent boys because they may not communicate subjective symptoms of depression, e.g., guilt, to observers.","anxiety, gender, depression, ratings"

"Although inherited coagulation factor deficiencies with negative bleeding histories are rare, cases such as the one presented herein may not be diagnosed at the time of surgery and may experience severe hemostatic problems postoperatively. It may be prudent to obtain an activated partial thromboplastin time preoperatively for all Ashkenazi Jews, including those with a negative history for a hemostatic disorder, because of the high incidence of factor XI deficiency in their population. Surgeons and anesthesiologists should be aware of the existence of this and other uncommon hemostatic disorders and their treatment when faced with serious, apparently unexplained postoperative hemorrhage.","life-threatening hemorrhage, ashkenazi jews, hemophilia c, factor xi"
"For the continued safe operation of a fixed offshore steel structure, it is necessary for any damage resulting from fatigue, collision or impact to be prevented from leading to either progressive failure or sudden collapse. The detection of fatigue damage at an early stage in the life of the structure is, however, difficult and costly, especially sub-sea, but the financial and human consequences of structural failure resulting from inadequate inspection are likely to be much greater, and need to be prevented. The paper describes research that has been undertaken to enable sub-sea inspection strategies to be improved. The findings relate the inspection methods used, the locations inspected and the frequency of inspection to the probability of local fatigue damage leading to unacceptable structural consequences. This provides a practical way of targeting offshore inspection in order to reduce overall life-cycle costs whilst maintaining adequate levels of system reliability for the complete structure.","risk, inspection planning, offshore steel structures, ndt, structural reliability, fatigue, fracture"
This chapter presents a biomechanical guidance navigation system for performing periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) to treat developmental dysplasia of the hip. The main motivation of the biomechanical guidance system (BGS) is to plan and track the osteotomized fragment in real time during PAO while simplifying this challenging procedure. The BGS computes the three-dimensional position of the osteotomized fragment in terms of conventional anatomical angles and simulates biomechanical states of the joint. This chapter describes the BGS structure and its application using two different navigation approaches including optical tracking of the fragment and x-ray-based navigation. Both cadaver studies and preliminary clinical studies showed that the biomechanical planning is consistent with traditional PAO planning techniques and that the additional information provided by accurate 3D positioning of the fragment does not adversely impact the surgery.,"Biomechanical guidance system, Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO), X-ray-based navigation"

"Anemia status is a typical feature of the ""frailty syndrome"" of elderly subjects. Increasing evidences suggest that low hemoglobin concentration is common in elderly subjects and adversely affects morbidity and mortality.In the present study, we evaluate the impact of hemoglobin concentration on the risk of all-cause mortality in a large population of frail and old subjects living in a nursing home.There were 372 residents admitted to the teaching nursing home of Catholic University of Rome aged 65 years and older from January 2002 to November 2004 who were enrolled. For the present study we selected all the subjects with a full MDS-NH assessment within 14 days after admission. The main outcome measure was the relative hazard ratio of death after 2 years of follow-up for different levels of hemoglobin concentration.Based on the WHO criteria for anemia, 235 participants were anemic at enrollment (63.1% of the cohort). A total of 130 deaths (44 men and 86 women) occurred during 2-years of follow-up. Death rates for those with and without anemia based on the WHO criteria were 38% and 28%, respectively (P = .03). The age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio for mortality was 1.56 (95% CI, 1.07-2.28) for persons with anemia. Compared with the lower tertile, the age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratios of mortality for hemoglobin in the second and third tertiles were 0.40 (95% CI, 0.26-0.61), and 0.39 (95% CI, 0.24-0.58), respectively. Adjusting for potential confounders, including markers of frailty, cognitive impairment, creatinine levels, cancer, stroke, body mass index, and pressure ulcer, somewhat reduced the strength of the association between hemoglobin level and mortality, but it remained statistically significant.Our results obtained from a representative sample of very old and frail elderly subjects living in a nursing home expand the knowledge that high levels of hemoglobin are associated with better survival. Anemia should be actively sought, appropriate diagnostic strategies should be implemented to search for potentially correctable causes, and aggressive interventions may be warranted to reduce mortality and improve functional status.","anemia, mortality, frail elderly, hemoglobin concentration"
"Formative constructs must influence two or more distinct outcome variables for meaningful tests of the formative conceptualization. Because the construct mediates the effects of its indicators, the indicators must have effects on the outcomes that are proportional to their effects on the formative construct itself. This constraint has important implications for developing and testing formative models. This study demonstrates the existence of the constraint, shows that researchers must consider proportionality as a criterion for evaluating the formative conceptualization, provides examples of indicators having different effects and interpretations depending on the outcome variables used, discusses the selection of outcomes to provide rigorous rather than trivial tests of the formative conceptualization, and contends that the formative nature of constructs cannot be justified in isolation from the consideration of outcome variables. In addition, the study demonstrates the importance of considering how the scaling of the formative construct influences the significance of the effects in the model.","likelihood ratio tests, measurement, formative constructs, causal indicators, likelihood ratio test"
"In offshore platforms, doubler plates are used to facilitate field installation of auxiliary structural components to the main structure. Recent research on the static strength of axially loaded doubler plate reinforced Circular Hollow Section (CHS) T- and X-joints showed that appropriately proportioned plates can significantly improve the joint strength. This paper extends the numerical study to doubler plate reinforced CHS X-joints subjected to in-plane bending through systematic variation of the main geometric parameters. The load transferring mechanisms and failure modes of such joints, with different doubler plate size and thickness, are investigated and compared to corresponding un-reinforced joints. Within the range of geometric parameters investigated, the doubler plate is observed to provide strength enhancement up to 240% for the corresponding un-reinforced joint. Strength equations are established using the computed results for assessment of the static strength of doubler plate reinforced X-joints, and design recommendations are provided for this joint type.","finite element analysis, in-plane bending, static strength, doubler plate, reinforced joints, failure mode"
"Two new methods were presented for stress measurements based on the hydraulic fracturing technique. These are the methods (i) and (ii) which do not use the reopening pressure, i.e., (i) the method using only the shut-in pressures for transverse cracks and (ii) the method using the actual reopening pressure of a longitudinal crack, which coincides actually with the reopening of the crack lip at the borehole wall. The former method can be estimated the range of error in the evaluated magnitudes and orientations of the remote stresses. These methods were applied to the results of hydraulic fracturing experiments performed at the Kamaishi mine in Japan. The reliability of the evaluated stress field was confirmed by comparing the stress field with that evaluated by the over coring method.","Shut-in Pressure, Stress Measurement, Stress Perturbation, Fracture, Field Test, Faults, Artificial Crack, Reopening Pressure, Hydraulic Fracturing, In Situ Rock Stress, Elasticity"
"The classical Levinson algorithm for computing the predictor polynomial relative to a real positive definite Toeplitz matrix is shown to be redundant in complexity. It can be broken down into two simpler algorithms, either of which needs only to be processed. This result can be interpreted in the framework of the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the real line as follows: the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the predictors relative to the sequence of Toeplitz matrices constitute two families of polynomials orthogonal on the interval [- 1,1] with respect to some even weight functions. It turns out that the recurrence relations for these orthogonal polynomials can be used efficiently to compute the desired predictor. The resulting ""split Levinson algorithm"" requires roughly one-half the number of multiplications and the same number of additions as the classical Levinson algorithm. A simple derivation of Cybenko's method for computing the Pisarenko frequencies is obtained from the recurrence relations underlying the split Levinson algorithm.","symmetric matrices, polynomials, recurrence relation, weight function, lattices, numerical stability, helium, digital signal processing, orthogonal polynomial, frequency, toeplitz matrix, positive definite"
"A methodology for identification and control of complex nonlinear plants using multi-model approach is presented in this paper. The proposed methodology is based on fuzzy decomposition of the steady state map. It is shown that such a decomposition strategy facilitates the design of input perturbation signals and helps in identifying linear or simple nonlinear models for each local region. A composition strategy to aggregate the local model predictions is proposed and shown to give excellent cross validation as well as to facilitate smooth switching between the local models. A novel control scheme that is based on the multi model strategy is proposed. The practicality of the identification and control scheme presented here is demonstrated by application to the continuous fermenter of Henson and Seborg (M.A. Henson, D.E. Seborg, Nonlinear control strategies for continuous fermenter, in: Proceedings of 1990 American Control Conference, San Diego, 1990), which exhibits severe nonlinearities and gain directionality changes.","steady state decomposition, fuzzy segregation, multi-model identification, nonlinear control, cross validation, steady state, nonlinear systems, model identification"
"This paper presents an experimental investigation on the hysteretic behavior of bolted-angle beam-to-column connections. The investigation focused on: (1) the inelastic behavior under large cyclic deformation, (2) the failure modes under cyclic loading, and (3) the energy-dissipation capacity of the bolted-angle connections. Two deformation patterns, distinguished by the relative strength of angles and bolts, had a significant influence on the hysteretic behavior of the connections. Based on the experimental results, hysteresis rules were established to lay a foundation for the development of a behavioral hysteresis model of bolted-angle connections.","semi-rigid connection, bolted angle, experiment, cyclic, energy dissipation, failure mode"
"In this paper the behavior of steel pipes, filled and unfilled with concrete, is studied under cyclic shear to examine the possibility of their use as a seismic damper. Two specimens of steel pipes filled inside with concrete are tested under monotonic and cyclic shear. Four other specimens of bare steel pipes are tested under fully reversed cyclic shear loading. The results show that the bare steel pipes are capable of absorbing a great amount of energy under a severe cyclic shear loading with a stable hysteretic behavior. This behavior is also simulated using the finite element method. Then, parametric studies are performed to investigate the effects of variations in geometrical properties of the pipe on its hysteretic behavior. A simplified bi-linear model is proposed to approximate the hysteretic behavior of the steel pipe as a metallic-yielding damper.","finite element method, steel pipe, seismic, shear test, hysteresis, damper, linear model"
"Previous studies have shown that ambient ultrafine particles with diameters less than 100nm (UFPs) can pass from the lungs to the circulation because of their very small diameter, and induce lung oxidative stress with a resultant dysfunction of lung endothelial cells. However, no studies have addressed the potential combined effects of UFPs and cigarette smoke on vascular endothelial cells. We hypothesized that co-exposure to UFPs and cigarette smoke extract (CSE) may cause combined effects on activation of endothelial cells and dysfunction of endothelium by oxidative stress through activation of NADPH oxidase. We determined the effects of UFPs with or without CSE on mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (MPMVEC) obtained from C57BL/6J (wild-type) and gp91(phox) knock-out mice (gp91(phox) is one of the key components of NADPH oxidase, one of ROS generators). Our results showed that exposure of MPMVEC from wild-type mice to UFPs or CSE, at a non-toxic dose, induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, increased phosphorylation of p38 and Erk1/2, and up-regulated early growth response -1 (Egr-1) and IL-6 genes. These effects were significantly enhanced when cells were co-exposed to both UFPs and CSE. However, exposure of MPMVEC from gp91(phox) knock-out mice did not induce the above effects. Furthermore, UFPs- and/or CSE-induced Egr-1 mRNA upregulation was attenuated significantly when cells were pre-treated with p38 specific inhibitor, SB 203580, or MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, and Egr-1 siRNA treatment abolished UFPs- and/or CSE-induced overexpression of IL-6. Our results suggest that UFPs and/or CSE caused activation of NADPH oxidase, resulting in ROS generation that led to activation of MAPKs through induced phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs and upregulation of Egr-1. Those effects may further result in endothelial dysfunction through production of cytokines such as IL-6. Our results suggest that co-exposure to UFPs and CSE causes enhanced injury to endothelial cells.","egr-1, gp91 phox, ultrafine particles, cigarette smoke extract, nadph oxidase, mapks, il-6, reactive oxygen species, particulate matter, interleukin 6"
"Vehicle side slip angle algorithm for VDC system was studied. A 15 DOF vehicle model was made, including 6 DOF of vehicle body, the rotation DOF and vertical movement DOF for each wheel and the steering DOF for front steering wheel. The side slip angles at the center of front axle and rear axle were calculated according to steering wheel angle, lateral acceleration, vehicle yaw rate and its variation. Vehicle side slip angle was calculated according to vehicle yaw rate and the side slip angles at the center of front axle and rear axle. Simulation results prove that this algorithm can accurately calculate the vehicle side slip angle under different road conditions and in a wide range of side slip angles.","15 DOF, Magic formula, Simulation, Vehicle dynamics, Vehicle side slip angle"
"A smart concrete module with embedded PZT ceramic element is proposed to monitor the health of the structure. Being embedded, the PZT ceramic is in a complicate environment which results in the changes of physical properties of PZT element. In this paper, a new method of measuring energy losses is first proposed to evaluate the effect of such physical changes. In order to measure the energy losses, the corresponding dissipation factors are calculated from the piezoelectric equivalent parameters. In the stress and temperature experiments, two kinds of PZT ceramic perform different features which also result in changes of energy losses. It is also found that when the environment temperature is unstable, the changes of the equivalent parameters are in fact the results of both the effects of stress and temperature. However, comparing the stress with temperature experimental results, it is found that the eigen frequencies of the embedded piezoelectric ceramic perform special characteristics that they are more sensitive to temperature than to stress. It enables us to solve the problem of the stress and temperature cross sensitivity.","embedded pzt ceramic element, environment temperature, structural engineering, structure health monitory, piezoceramics, intelligent structures, piezoelectric-ceramic-embedded smart concrete module, stress, concrete, condition monitoring, energy losses, piezoelectric equivalent parameters, dissipation factors, physical properties"
"Genetic identification among cinnamon species was studied by analyzing nucleotide sequences of chloroplast DNA from four species (Cinnamomum cassia, C. zeylanicum, C. burmannii and C. sieboldii). The two regions studied were the intergenic spacer region between the trnL 3'exon and trnF exon (trnL -trnF IGS) and the trnL intron region. We found nucleotide variation at one site in the trnL-trnF IGS, and at three sites in the trnL intron. With the sequence data from analysis of these regions, the four Cinnamomum species used in this study were correctly identified. Furthermore, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of PCR products from the trnL-trnF IGS and the trnL intron resulted in different SSCP band patterns among C. cassia, C. zeylanicum and C. burmannii.","genetics, chloroplast dna, nucleotide sequence, identification, genetic variability, bark, molecular biology"
"The asexual developmental pathway in the life cycle of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa culminates in the formation of spores called conidia. Several clones of genomic Neurospora DNA have been isolated that correspond to mRNA species expressed during conidiation and not during mycelial growth (V. Berlin and C. Yanofsky, Mol. Cell. Biol. 5:849-855, 1985). In this paper we describe the characterization of one of these clones, named pCon-10a. This clone contains two genes, con-10 and con-13, which are induced coordinately during the later stages of conidiation. The two genes are separated by 1.4 kilobases of DNA; they are located on linkage group IV and are transcribed from the same strand of DNA. The molecular organization and sequence of one of these genes, con-10, and its flanking regions are presented. Full-length cDNA clones for con-10 also were isolated and sequenced, and transcription-initiation and polyadenylation sites were defined. The con-10 gene contains an open reading frame interrupted by two small introns and encodes an 86-amino-acid residue polypeptide that is both hydrophilic and weakly acidic. Expression of the con-10 gene in various mutants defective at different stages of conidiation indicates that it plays a role after aerial hyphal development. Possible functions, organization, and regulation of conidiation-specific genes are discussed.","gene expression regulation, molecular biology, morphology, dna cloning, mutation, proteins, nucleic acid hybridization, nucleic acids, life cycle, gene regulation, amino acid, spores, nucleic acid, messenger rna, gene expression, cell differentiation, amino acid sequence, genetic mapping, cloning, phenotype, transcription, molecular structure, open reading frame"
"Use of cold-formed sections as composite beams in slab systems offers high flexibility in design and several advantages. Among these advantages are the enabling of shallow overall slab depth, easy adaptation to irregular geometries, freedom in design of cross-sections and ready availability of materials and sections. The main problem in implementation of the designs is ensuring adequate shear transfer between the concrete slab and the cold-formed beam section, whose thickness is often too small for welding of conventional shear studs. The paper presents designs and test results for several technologies involving cold-formed sections in composite construction, including self-drilling screwed cold-formed shear connectors, and built-up sections bolted to precast concrete planks. The tests include extensive push-out tests of numerous types of connectors, as well as full-scale composite element tests. Results indicate that design of shear connectors can in most cases be conservatively based on codes of practice for the design of cold-formed connections. Full-scale tests indicate high ductility and capacity which exceeds design assumptions.","beams and girders, composite structures, structural frameworks, cold formed sections, cross section"
"To analyze the genetic and epigenetic alterations of RUNX3 gene, a potential putative tumor suppressor gene, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).PCR-based loss of heterozygosity (LOH) detection, analysis of mutation with PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and sequencing, and methylation study with methylation specific PCR (MSP) were performed on RUNX3 gene in a series of 62 HCCs along with their matched normal tissues.Mutation of RUNX3 gene was not found, but one single nucleotide polymorphism with T to A transversion at the second nucleotide of the 18th codon was found. Nine of 26 informative cases (34.6%) showed allelic loss on the polymorphic site and 30 cases (48.4%) revealed hypermethylation of RUNX3 gene in promoter CpG islands. Furthermore, of the 9 cases with LOH, 8 (88.9%) also had hypermethylation.Our findings indicate that inactivation of RUNX3 gene through allelic loss and promoter hypermethylation might be one of the major mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinogenesis.","methylation specific pcr, single nucleotide polymorphism, genetics, polymorphism, single strand conformation polymorphism, nucleotides, cpg island, loss of heterozygosity"
"In an outbreak of giardiasis at two day-care nurseries in metropolitan Toranto Giardia lamblia appeared to be transmitted person to person. No common source of infection could be found. The proportions of children infected in the two nurseries were 39% and 17%; infection was spread to 7% and 23% of their household contacts. Of the infected children and household contacts 26% and 30% respectively of those for whom detailed information could be obtained were symptomatic. Canadian children were more likely to be infected and symptomatic than were immigrant children attending the nurseries. The most susceptible ages for infection were 1 to 3 years. The results of this study suggest that all children in day-care nurseries who are infected with G. lamblia should be treated, regardless of whether they are symptomatic.","feces, outbreaks, epidemiology, therapy"
"Reducing strategic risk has become an issue of paramount importance to corporations. One way to reduce such risk is through international operations. However, published research reports conflicting findings on the relationship between international operations and risk reduction. In addition, the literature leaves one avenue largely unexplored, namely, industry influence. Using a sample of 367 firms, this study tests for the relationship between internationalization and risk across global and multi-domestic industries. Study findings indicate a negative relationship between risk and internationalization, indicating that firms are benefited by reduced risk through internationalization. Additionally, regression models indicate the incremental rate of benefits due to internationalization is greater in the case of global industries, compared to multi-domestic industries.","international operations, strategic risk, global and multi-domestic industry, regression model, risk reduction"
The complex natural resonances (CNR) for lossless dielectric spheres in a lossless dielectric medium are investigated. Significant differences between the external and internal resonances are presented. The external resonances are related to the external creeping waves and the internal resonances to the internally reflected waves. The internal resonances are more important in practice because of their smaller damping factors.

"In this paper, a family of new de Bruijn sequences is proposed through the construction of maximum-length nonlinear feedback shift registers (NFSRs). Let $k$ be a positive integer and $p_{0}(x), p_{1}(x), ldots , p_{k}(x)$ be the primitive polynomials in $mathbb {F}_{2}[x]$ with their degrees strictly increasing and pairwise coprime. We determine the cycle structure and adjacency graphs of linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) with characteristic polynomial $q(x)=prod nolimits _{i=0}^{k}p_{i}(x)$ . In the case that $p_{0}(x)=1+x$ , an algorithm is proposed to produce maximum-length NFSRs from these LFSRs, and it is shown that the algorithm can generate $O(2^{(2^{k}-1)n})~n$ -stage maximum-length NFSRs with memory complexity $O(2^{k}kn)$ and time complexity $O(2^{n-d_{k}}kn)$ , where $n$ and $d_{k}$ are the degrees of $q(x)$ and $p_{k}(x)$ , respectively. Finally, we illustrate the proposed algorithm in the case of $k=2$ . In this case, we prove that for any integer $ngeq 8$ , the algorithm can produce $n$ -stage maximum-length NFSRs with time complexity as low as $O(n^{{rm {log}{log}}(n)}$ ).","De Bruijn sequence, LFSR, NFSR, cycle structure, primitive polynomial"
"This paper describes the first national burden of disease study for South Africa. The main focus is the burden due to premature mortality, i.e. years of life lost (YLLs). In addition, estimates of the burden contributed by morbidity, i.e. the years lived with disability (YLDs), are obtained to calculate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs); and the impact of AIDS on premature mortality in the year 2010 is assessed.Owing to the rapid mortality transition and the lack of timely data, a modelling approach has been adopted. The total mortality for the year 2000 is estimated using a demographic and AIDS model. The non-AIDS cause-of-death profile is estimated using three sources of data: Statistics South Africa, the National Department of Home Affairs, and the National Injury Mortality Surveillance System. A ratio method is used to estimate the YLDs from the YLL estimates.The top single cause of mortality burden was HIV/AIDS followed by homicide, tuberculosis, road traffic accidents and diarrhoea. HIV/AIDS accounted for 38% of total YLLs, which is proportionately higher for females (47%) than for males (33%). Pre-transitional diseases, usually associated with poverty and underdevelopment, accounted for 25%, non-communicable diseases 21% and injuries 16% of YLLs. The DALY estimates highlight the fact that mortality alone underestimates the burden of disease, especially with regard to unintentional injuries, respiratory disease, and nervous system, mental and sense organ disorders. The impact of HIV/AIDS is expected to more than double the burden of premature mortality by the year 2010.This study has drawn together data from a range of sources to develop coherent estimates of premature mortality by cause. South Africa is experiencing a quadruple burden of disease comprising the pre-transitional diseases, the emerging chronic diseases, injuries, and HIV/AIDS. Unless interventions that reduce morbidity and delay morbidity become widely available, the burden due to HIV/AIDS can be expected to grow very rapidly in the next few years. An improved base of information is needed to assess the morbidity impact more accurately.","sex ratio, quality adjusted life years, cause of death, statistical model, accuracy, poverty, demography, homicide"

The addition of visual, tactual and kinesthetic cues to hearing did not significantly increase the accuracy of tuning. Subjects with alleged absolute pitch were more accurate than the others but ""the great overlap questions the use of the term 'absolute pitch' as a special indicator of accuracy.""

"Various types of braces are used to prevent buckling of structures and increase buckling strength. While bracing requirements of elastic structures are well explained, those of inelastic structures are not fully developed. Experimental and analytical studies were conducted to determine bracing requirements of inelastic columns. In the experimental study, columns with a brace at mid height were loaded to their maximum limit with the brace stiffness at the mid height as the main variable. The tangent modulus of the columns which governs the inelastic buckling loads was kept constant. An analytical study was also performed to compare with the experimental results. The columns were modeled and analyzed by the finite element program, ABAQUS. It was found through the experimental and analytical studies that the bracing requirements for inelastic columns depend on the number of braces, the buckling load, and the length of a column but not on the material state. The results show that Winter's simplified method to determine full brace requirements can be applied to inelastic members as well as elastic members.","brace, bracing, column brace, column, inelastic buckling"
"Preprocessor annotations (e.g., #ifdef in C) enable the development of similar, but distinct software variants from a common code base. One particularly popular preprocessor is the C preprocessor, cpp. But the cpp is also widely criticized for impeding software maintenance by making code hard to understand and change. Yet, evidence to support this criticism is scarce. In this paper, we investigate the relation between cpp usage and maintenance effort, which we approximate with the frequency and extent of source code changes. To this end, we mined the version control repositories of eight open- source systems written in C. For each system, we measured if and how individual functions use cpp annotations and how they were changed. We found that functions containing cpp annotations are generally changed more frequently and more profoundly than other functions. However, when accounting for function size, the differences disappear or are greatly diminished. In summary, with respect to the frequency and extent of changes, our findings do not support the criticism of the cpp regarding maintainability.","annotations, change-proneness, maintenance, preprocessors, variability"
"The present work first introduces and then demonstrates the possibilities of a novel high resolution topographical difference method. The method comprises two techniques to measure the actual local wear volume and to map the distribution of wear. Both techniques are based on comparing the topography of the same surface region before and after testing. The combination of mapping and measuring the wear makes it a valuable method both for wear testing and for fundamental studies on wear. The method has no principal restriction to a specific topographical technique. In the present investigation, however, only the atomic force microscope (AFM) has been used. To investigate and demonstrate the techniques, four tests have been performed. Three tests involved changing the initial topography of ground steel specimens by scratching or polishing. The fourth demonstration involved the wear of hydraulic motor cam rollers. These techniques promise to bring evaluation of wear to a new level of sensitivity and detail. The extremely high resolution may improve tribological testing of real machine elements by reducing the need for excessively accelerated tests or extremely long test times.","local wear volume, micro scale, distribution map of wear, high resolution, atomic force microscope, friction"

"The new landscape of human transcriptome along with the identification of numerous long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has dramatically altered our approach to study diseases. It is now imperative to decipher the biological functions of these transcripts and how they impact on human cell and pathophysiology. Nonetheless, already at this very early stage of their study, the involvement of lncRNAs in cell transformation is emerging as a key aspect. Recently, researchers have started to explore the implications of lncRNAs alteration in hepatic pathophysiology. In this review, we will discuss in detail several examples of liver disease-relevant lncRNAs. Many lncRNAs have been shown to play a major role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). For such type of tumor with an increasing incidence and a high mortality rate, it is crucial to identify new therapeutic targets and biomarkers to predict response to therapy. LncRNAs present as a promising new resource. One major challenge for the future would be to systematically address the lncRNAs expression among the different cellular components of the liver. To achieve this goal, a combination of clinically driven, genetically defined, morphologically classified, and molecular-based studies will have to be performed. In conclusion, lncRNAs will undoubtedly provide a rewarding field of study and most importantly a new resource to identify new disease associated biomarkers and molecular targets for therapy for liver diseases.","hepatocellular carcinoma, liver diseases, lncrnas, encode"
"Currently, the deterioration of bridge conditions is causing many problems. Therefore, the work reported in this paper was carried out to survey the present condition of railway bridges in Vietnam, concentrating on steel deficiencies. Literature reviews were initiated to identify common defects with site inspections and personal interviews to ascertain their validity. Finding the defects draws an overall picture of Vietnamese railway bridges that are in poor physical condition, thus providing poor serviceability. Besides structural failure, local defects were already identified, consisting of corrosion, fatigue, functional obsolescence and aging. New problems that have been identified are human invasions and missing elements. It is widely considered that overload, collision impacts, adverse climate conditions and poor maintenance are the main causes. Additionally, this paper includes previous wars, improper data keeping, and elemental burglary as country-specific causes. It suggests that maintenance efforts should be prioritized to eliminate these deficiencies. Trained maintenance crews need to be established and further research should be carried out to create an adequate maintenance management system in Vietnam.","bridges, railway, causes, failure, vietnam, deficiencies"

We show here that, after nuclear transfer to amphibian oocytes, mitotic chromatin is reprogrammed up to 100 times faster than interphase nuclei. We find that, as cells traverse mitosis, their genes pass through a temporary phase of unusually high responsiveness to oocyte reprogramming factors (mitotic advantage). Mitotic advantage is not explained by nuclear penetration, DNA modifications, histone acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, nor by salt soluble chromosomal proteins. Our results suggest that histone H2A deubiquitination may account, at least in part, for the acquisition of mitotic advantage. They support the general principle that a temporary access of cytoplasmic factors to genes during mitosis may facilitate somatic cell nuclear reprogramming and the acquisition of new cell fates in normal development.","cell line, mitosis, chromatin, histones"
"Purpose: This report describes an ongoing transition from the help Hospital Information System to help II, a replacement Health Information System built to manage clinical information captured in a variety of medical settings. The focus of the article is on the medical decision support provided by this system and studied by researchers at the University of Utah and Intermountain Health Care (IHC), a large health care organization in Utah, for many years. Methods: Select success features of the original help system's decision support environment are identified and lessons learned are related. Plans for transferring these features to help II are discussed. Results: The article focuses on four features: (1) the importance of easy access to patient data essential for decision support, (2) the commitment to continued measurement and revision of both the logic and the interventional strategy in a decision support application, (3) experience with data mining as a tool for developing decision support tools, and (4) the role of clinical reports in supporting the decision making process.","information systems, information system, clinical decision support, health care, data mining, decision making process, decision support, decision support system, health information system"

"A practical theory of argumentation is outlined and applied to a hypothetical clinical scenario to elucidate the use of research evidence in individual treatment decisions. The primary role of research evidence is to establish warrants as opposed to warrant using. Warrants are defined as the rules, principles or interpretive rationales used to justify an inference from observed data to conclusion, or clinical claim. Clarity on the appropriate use of research evidence in clinical decision-making can help resolve current debates over the nature and consequences of evidence-based medicine. The theory of argumentation has potential to inform both the design of decision support tools and to provide criteria for assessing decisional performance.","heuristics, argument, evidence, decision-making, evidence based medicine, treatment, performance, modeling"
"The aim of this study was to describe perceived abuse in adult Spanish and Ecuadorian women and men and to assess its association with mental health. A population-based survey was conducted in Spain in 2006. Data were taken from a probabilistic sample allowing for an equal number of men and women, Spaniards and Ecuadorians. Mental disorder was measured with the General Health Questionnaire-28. The nine questions on exposure to physical, sexual, and psychological abuse during the previous year were self-administered. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association between exposure to abuse and poor mental health, adjusting for potential confounders. The sample was composed of 1,059 individuals aged 18 to 54, 104 of whom reported physical, psychological, or sexual abuse. Some 6% refused to answer the questions on abuse. Overall, reported abuse ranged from 13% in Ecuadorian women to 5% in Spanish men. Psychological abuse was the most frequent. Half the abused women, both Spanish and Ecuadorian, reported intimate partner violence (IPV), as did 22% of abused men. Poor mental health was found in 61% of abused Spanish women (adjusted Odds Ratio [ORa] = 5.1; 95% CI: 1.8-14.4), and 62% abused Ecuadorian women (ORa = 4; 95% CI: 2-7.9), in 36% of abused Spanish men (ORa = 3; 95% CI: 0.9-10.7) and in 30% abused Ecuadorian men (ORa = 2.8; 95% CI: 1-7.7). Interpersonal violence is frequent in relations with the partner, the family, and outside the family, and it seriously affects the mental health. Ecuadorian women stand out as the most vulnerable group.","mental health and violence, violence exposure, anything related to domestic violence, domestic violence"
"One hundred children aged 1 to 15 years were randomly allocated to two equal groups. All underwent cold orthopedic surgery to the lower limb, of more than 1 hour's duration with a standard anesthetic technique. One group received caudal bupivacaine 0.25%, 0.7 mL/kg, and one group acted as controls. There were no cases of fecal incontinence in the theater complex but urinary incontinence in the immediate recovery phase increased from 14% in the control group to 34% in the caudal group ( P <.05). The caudal block had a duration of effect lasting 5 to 6 hours, and provided better recovery room analgesia ( P <.01). The advantages for the child are discussed.","orthopedic surgery, caudal, analgesia, bupivacaine"
"To determine the effectiveness and safety of the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis in women undergoing cesarean section.Four hundred and forty-one women undergoing cesarean sections were randomly assigned either to a single dose of 1 g intravenous cefazolin or placebo after clamping of the umbilical cord. The primary outcome was the development of post-operative febrile morbidity and the secondary outcomes were infection-related complications.There were 211 emergency and 230 elective cesarean sections. In the emergency cesarean sections, 34 (30.6%) women developed post-operative febrile morbidity in the placebo group compared to 11 (11%) women in the cefazolin group. This was a statistically significant difference (P = 0.001). Similarly, there were statistically significant differences between the two groups in the development of wound infection (P<0.001), use of therapeutic antibiotics (P = 0.001), and post-operative days in hospital (P = 0.003). No statistically significant differences were detected in the development of other infection-related complications. In the elective cesarean sections, no statistically significant differences were found in post-operative febrile morbidity and infection-related complications. There were no serious side effects related to the use of cefazolin.The routine use of a single dose of cefazolin is safe and effective in emergency but not elective cesarean section.","side effect, statistical significance, prophylaxis, section, antibiotic"
"Evolutionary structural optimization is applied to determine the optimum shape of steel gusset plates subjected to axial forces. A number of different gusset plates used in various types of connections is considered for this purpose. The evolutionary structural optimization approach is employed to find the optimum shapes of a gusset plate used in these connections. The first example considers a gusset plate having two holes which are utilized in the connection of double angle carrying a tensile force. Within this example the effect of certain parameters in the evolutionary structural optimization process such as material removal ratio, mesh size and modeling of holes on the final shape is investigated. The gusset plates having three, four and five holes are also designed for optimal shape. Furthermore design examples include two rows of multiple holes as well as staggered holes and connections with multiple members. The final shapes obtained in the single member bolted connections are generally similar to those used in practice. However, they are lighter. Those shapes obtained for the multiple member connections and welded double angle connections are unpredictable. Although the shapes obtained in all the examples are lighter than the ones used in practice, they might be more expensive to produce. It is shown that the evolutionary structural optimization method has a potential in determining the optimum shape of gusset plates.","Steel structures, Bolted connections, Evolutionary structural optimization, Gusset plates, Shape optimization, Finite element discretization, Welded connections"
"To evaluate the ability of the DSM-IV criteria for the pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) to reliably and accurately differentiate PDD subtypes.The sample consisted of 143 children with various types of developmental disabilities. A diagnosis of PDD and PDD subtype was made by one clinician using information obtained from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. The raw data from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, clinical notes (excluding diagnostic opinion), Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, IQ, and other available data were independently assessed by three experienced raters, each of whom then made a separate, blind diagnosis. If there was any disagreement, a consensus best-estimate (CBE) diagnosis was made after discussion. To assess reliability, the agreement between the three raters was calculated using k. Accuracy was assessed by calculating the agreement between the clinician's diagnosis and the CBE and by calculating the error rates associated with the three raters using latent class analysis.The current DSM-IV criteria show good to excellent reliability for the diagnosis of PDD, Asperger's disorder (AsD), and autism, but they show poor reliability for the diagnosis of atypical autism. The clinician (compared to the CBE) had little difficulty differentiating PDD from non-PDD children and autism from AsD but had more difficulty identifying children with atypical autism. The latent class analysis also showed that the average error rates of the three raters for a differentiation of atypical autism from autism were unacceptably high.Although the psychometric properties of the current DSM-IV criteria for autism and AsD appear quite acceptable, there is likely to be a high rate of misclassification of children given a diagnosis of atypical autism.","disorder subtypes, reliability, diagnosis, pervasive developmental, accuracy"
"In so far as personality traits contribute to vocational success or failure the Rorschach method can be used as a vocational aid. In the general application of the method to vocational problems the examiner endeavors to conclude for which occupation the subject's personality best fits him. In the specific application of the method attention is paid only to certain Rorschach components as indicators of specific vocationally significant personality traits. The specific application requires preliminary investigations to identify special Rorschach components and to prove their vocational significance.

"Though value has received significant attention in the marketing literature in recent years, research on the concept has been somewhat limited in the context of online shopping, particularly in regards to empirical hypothesis testing. This paper examines the relevancy of value dimensions for online shopping and the relationship between value dimensions, preference towards the Internet retailer, and intentions. Findings from the large-scale study indicate that utilitarian value is more strongly related than hedonic value to preference towards the Internet retailer and intentions and that shopping frequency can play a moderating role. The paper concludes with a discussion of limitations and managerial implications.","utilitarian value, online shopping, hedonic value, preference, internet, hypothesis test"
"This paper discusses some crucial issues associated with the exploitation of data and information about health care for the improvement of patient safety. In particular, the issues of human factors and safety management are analysed in relation to exploitation of reports about non-conformity events and field observations. A methodology for integrating field observation and theoretical approaches for safety studies is described. Two sample cases are discussed in detail: the first one makes reference to the use of data collected in the aviation domain and shows how these can be utilised to define hazard and risk; the second one concerns a typical ethnographic study in a large hospital structure for the identification of most relevant areas of intervention. The results show that, if national authorities find a way to harmonise and formalise critical aspects, such as the severity of standard events, it is possible to estimate risk and define auditing needs, well before the occurrence of serious incidents, and to indicate practical ways forward for improving safety standards.","risk assessment, data collection, human error, human factors engineering, human factors, health care"
"Prokaryotic viruses, or bacteriophages, are viruses that infect bacteria and archaea. These viruses have been known to associate with host systems for decades, yet only recently have their influence on the regulation of host-associated bacteria been appreciated. These studies have been conducted in many host systems, from the base of animal life in the Cnidarian phylum to mammals. These prokaryotic viruses are useful for regulating the number of bacteria in a host ecosystem and for regulating the strains of bacteria useful for the microbiome. These viruses are likely selected by the host to maintain bacterial populations. Viral metagenomics allows researchers to profile the communities of viruses associating with animal hosts, and importantly helps to determine the functional role these viruses play. Further, viral metagenomics show the sphere of viral involvement in gene flow and gene shuffling in an ever-changing host environment. The influence of prokaryotic viruses could, therefore, have a clear impact on host health.","Bacteriophage, Holobiont, Host-microbe interactions, Metagenomics, Microbiome, Prokaryotic virus, Symbiosis, Viral metagenomes, Virome"
"The quantification of software reliability is needed for the system engineering of products involving computer programs and the scheduling and monitoring of software development. It is also valuable for the comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of various design, coding, testing, and documentation techniques. This paper outlines a theory of software reliability based on execution or cpu time, and a concomitant model of the testing and debugging process that permits execution time to be related to calendar time. The estimation of parameters of the model is discussed. Application of the theory in scheduling and monitoring software projects is described, and data taken from several actual projects are presented.","concomitant model, actual project, cpu time, calendar time, software reliability measurement, execution time, software project, computer program, software development, software reliability, comparative evaluation"
"Near band edge photoluminescence (PL) of ZnS layers MBE-grown on GaP is investigated at 4.2K under fully strained, partially relaxed and fully relaxed conditions. PL peaks are attributed to heavy-hole (hh) or light-hole (lh)-related transitions by comparison with the calculated strain shift for the hh and lh bandgaps. It is shown that, while the free-to-bound (e,A 0 ) transition retains its hh character over the whole range from fully strained to fully relaxed conditions, a hh-lh exciton crossover is observed at intermediate strain. This observation is interpreted within the hydrogenic model for shallow states by scaling the hh-related ionisation energies with the lh to hh effective mass ratio and comparing the result with the strain shift of the lh bandgap. Values for the deformation potentials are derived and compared with theoretical and earlier experimental ones.","a. semiconductors, a. thin films, d. optical properties, e. luminescence, d. electronic states (localized), effective mass, thin film"
"Depression often is comorbid with conduct disorder. The purpose of this study is to assess whether, among youths with conduct disorder, those with depression differ in other ways from those without depression.Ninety-nine delinquent boys (aged 13 through 19 years) were evaluated with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children and other instruments. All boys had conduct disorder and substance use disorders.Staff-rated and self-rated depression scores correlated significantly. Twenty-one boys had major depression and/or dysthymia. Depressed boys had more substance dependence diagnoses and were more likely to have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and anxiety disorders, compared with the nondepressed boys. Depressed boys tended to develop conduct symptoms earlier than did the nondepressed boys. Depression scores did not change after at least 4 weeks of abstinence, for either depressed or nondepressed boys.Depressed delinquents have more substance dependence diagnoses, tend to initiate behavioral problems at an earlier age, have increased anxiety and attentional problems, and more trauma effects, than nondepressed delinquents. Depression does not appear to be related to substance intoxication, since it is not alleviated after 4 weeks of abstinence. Such boys may require combined psychiatric and substance treatment.","comorbidity, adolescents, conduct disorder, substance use disorder, depression, substance dependence"
"Codon models of evolution have facilitated the interpretation of selective forces operating on genomes. These models, however, assume a single rate of non-synonymous substitution irrespective of the nature of amino acids being exchanged. Recent developments have shown that models which allow for amino acid pairs to have independent rates of substitution offer improved fit over single rate models. However, these approaches have been limited by the necessity for large alignments in their estimation. An alternative approach is to assume that substitution rates between amino acid pairs can be subdivided into rate classes, dependent on the information content of the alignment. However, given the combinatorially large number of such models, an efficient model search strategy is needed. Here we develop a Genetic Algorithm (GA) method for the estimation of such models. A GA is used to assign amino acid substitution pairs to a series of rate classes, where is estimated from the alignment. Other parameters of the phylogenetic Markov model, including substitution rates, character frequencies and branch lengths are estimated using standard maximum likelihood optimization procedures. We apply the GA to empirical alignments and show improved model fit over existing models of codon evolution. Our results suggest that current models are poor approximations of protein evolution and thus gene and organism specific multi-rate models that incorporate amino acid substitution biases are preferred. We further anticipate that the clustering of amino acid substitution rates into classes will be biologically informative, such that genes with similar functions exhibit similar clustering, and hence this clustering will be useful for the evolutionary fingerprinting of genes.","molecular evolution, markov model, amino acids, genetic algorithm, amino acid, evolutionary genetics, sequence alignment, maximum likelihood, information content"
"Background: The 3 year survival after pulmonary metastatectomy for osteosarcoma (OS) is approximately 30%. Resection of metastatic disease can prolong life in pediatric patients with OS. Our objective is to assess the outcome of pediatric patients with pulmonary metastases located centrally as compared to peripheral lesions. Methods: A retrospective review of patients 0 to 21 years with a diagnosis of OS with pulmonary metastases on CT scan between 1985 and 2000 was completed. Demographics, metastasis location, survival, morbidity and mortality were evaluated. Results: Of 115 patients who had pulmonary metastasis secondary to OS, there were 96 wedge resections and 13 lobectomy/pneumonectomies in 84 patients. The morbidity of wedge resection was 9% and lobectomy/ pneumonectomy was 8%. There were no deaths from surgery. The median survival for patients undergoing lobectomy compared to wedge resection was 0.61 and 1.14 years respectively but did not reach statistical significance. The median overall survival for the entire cohort was 0.75 years. The median overall survival after initial detection of metastatic disease was 1.06 years among the patients with peripheral disease, compared to 0.38 years in patients with central disease (p=0.008). Conclusion: Patients with central pulmonary metastases in osteosarcoma have a very poor prognosis, even after operative treatment, compared to those with peripheral disease. Patients with central lesions may benefit from other non-surgical treatment options.","lobectomy, thoracotomy, osteosarcoma, wedge resection, pulmonary metastases, surgery, proportional hazards models, retrospective studies, young adult"
"The effect of repetitive primary afferent C-fibre stimulation on the responses of single wide dynamic range neurones recorded in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord have been exaemined in the unanaesthetised decerebrate-spinal rat. Prolonged stimulation of the sural nerve at 0.5 Hz or higher produced both a progressive increase in the latency of the sural evoked C-responses in all units and a decrease or habituation of the number of C-evoked spikes in the majority of units (62%) recorded in laminae 5 and 6. The shift in latency of the C responses in the dorsal horn neurones was found to be the result of an activity-dependent reduction in the conduction velocity of the primary afferent C-fibres, but such stimulation did not decrease the size of the C compound action potential or produce a block in conduction of single polymodal C-fibres which could account for the habituation of the dorsal horn neurones. A complete habituation or failure of the C-evoked response in a dorsal horn neurone produced by repetitive stimulation of a peripheral nerve was associated with a reduction but not the abolishment of the convergent C-input from an adjacent untetanized nerve, indicating that the habituation did not occur as the result of a postsynaptic inhibition of the dorsal horn neurone. Following a C-tetanus (10 Hz for 10 s) applied to the sural nerve a short and partial homosynaptic post-tetanic inhibition of the subsequent C responses evoked from the sural occurs. Such sural nerve C-tetani however produced a much more powerful and prolonged heterosynaptic post-tetanic inhibition of the C-responses evoked from the common peroneal nerve in those units with convergent C-input from both these two adjacent nerves. None of the effects of repetitive peripheral C-fibre stimulation on the C-evoked responses in the dorsal horn could be produced by A-fibre conditioning stimuli applied at identical frequencies. These results indicate that there is a segmentally organized C afferent-mediated inhibition of C-evoked responses in dorsal horn neurones that is generated both by the C-input that evoked those responses and by adjacent C-inputs.","Dorsal horn, Unmyelinated (C) fibres, Spinal cord, Habituation, Post-tetanic inhibition"
"In this paper we outline and evaluate competing explanations for a heroin shortage that occurred in Australia during 2001 with an abrupt onset at the beginning of 2001.We evaluated each of the explanations offered for the shortage against evidence from a variety of sources: government reports, police and drug law enforcement documents and briefings, key informant (KI) interviews, indicator data and research data.No similar shortage occurred at the same time in other markets (e.g. Vancouver, Canada or Hong Kong) whose heroin originated in the same countries as Australia's. The shortage was due most probably to a combination of factors that operated synergistically and sequentially. The heroin market had grown rapidly in the late 1990s, perhaps helped by a decline in drug law enforcement (DLE) in Australia in the early 1990s that facilitated high-level heroin suppliers in Asia to establish large-scale importation heroin networks into Australia. This led to an increase in the availability of heroin, increasingly visible street-based drug markets, increased purity and decreased price of heroin around the country. The Australian heroin market was well established by the late 1990s, but it had a low profit margin with high heroin purity, and a lower price than ever before. The surge in heroin problems led to increased funding of the Australian Federal Police and Customs as part of the National Illicit Drug Strategy in 1998-99, with the result that a number of key individuals and large seizures occurred during 1999-2000, probably increasing the risks of large-scale importation. The combination of low profits and increased success of law enforcement may have reduced the dependability of key suppliers of heroin to Australia at a time when seized heroin was becoming more difficult to replace because of reduced supplies in the Golden Triangle. These factors may have reduced the attractiveness of Australia as a destination for heroin trafficking.The Australian heroin shortage in 2001 was due probably to a combination of factors that included increased effectiveness of law enforcement efforts to disrupt networks bringing large shipments of heroin from traditional source countries, and decreased capacity or willingness of major traffickers to continue large scale shipments to Australia.","drug supply, law enforcement, supply reduction., heroin, drug policy, reduction, impact, psychiatry, profitability, availability, substance abuse"
"We determined cDNAs of two genes that belong to the Rhesus (Rh) blood group gene family in an amphioxus species (Branchiostoma floridae) and designated them Rh-related-1 (RhR-1) and Rh-related-2 (RhR-2). RhR-1 and RhR-2 consisted of 10 and 11 exons, respectively. 3' UTR sequences of RhR-1 were shorter (220-272 bp) than those of RhR-2 (1,505-1,650 bp). CDS lengths were 1,344 and 1,476 bp for RhR-1 and RhR-2, respectively, and the average nucleotide difference between their CDS regions was 0.33. The corresponding regions of Rh genes from exons 2 to 7 were relatively conserved among the chordate species examined in this study. Length difference numbers were in multiples of three, which implies that codon frames were conserved among them, and the same exon/intron boundary phases were observed in those regions. This region was used for the phylogenetic analyses. RhR-1 and RhR-2 formed a cluster on the phylogenetic tree of the Rh gene family. Gene duplication time of RhR-1 and RhR-2 was estimated to be ca. 500 million years ago. It is likely that the four Rh family genes in vertebrates emerged by gene duplications in the common ancestor of vertebrates, and functional differentiation has occurred after the first gene duplication.","rh, blood groups, evolution, phylogeny"
"Starting from the complete set of equations of hydrodynamics and nonequilibrium thermodynamics for a binary uni-univalent salt in an electrolyte solution contained between electrodes, we have solved, in part, both the transient and the steady-state thermal diffusion problems. Full account is taken of nonvanishing space charge near the electrodes. Formulas are obtained for the temperature distribution, the electric field, the salt concentration distribution, the charge distribution, and the voltage. The effect of Joule heating on the temperature distribution is very small. The effect of space charge on the electric field and on the salt concentration distribution is also small. Applications both to solid-state ionic devices such as batteries and to thermal diffusion measurements in aqueous electrolyte solutions are mentioned.","thermal diffusion, ther- mocells., ion transport, solid-state batteries, space charge, joule heating, electric field, steady state, charge distribution, nonequilibrium thermodynamics"
"The software package Bain can be used for the evaluation of informative hypotheses with respect to the parameters of a wide range of statistical models. For pairs of hypotheses the support in the data is quantified using the approximate adjusted fractional Bayes factor (BF). Currently, the data have to come from one population or have to consist of samples of equal size obtained from multiple populations. If samples of unequal size are obtained from multiple populations, the BF can be shown to be inconsistent. This paper examines how the approach implemented in Bain can be generalized such that multiple-population data can properly be processed. The resulting multiple-population approximate adjusted fractional Bayes factor is implemented in the R package Bain.","Bain, Bayes factor, informative hypotheses, multiple populations"
"Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases are kept in a repressed state by intramolecular interactions involving the SH3 and SH2 domains of the enzymes. Ligands for these domains can displace the intramolecular associations and activate the kinases. Here, we carried out in vitro activation experiments with purified, down-regulated hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck), a Src family kinase. We show that SH3 and SH2 ligands act cooperatively to activate Src family kinases: the presence of one ligand lowers the concentration of the second ligand necessary for activation. To confirm the findings in intact cells, we studied Cas, a Src substrate that possesses SH2 and SH3 ligands. In contrast to wild-type Cas, mutant forms of Cas lacking the SH3 or SH2 ligands were unable to stimulate Src autophosphorylation when expressed in Cas-deficient fibroblasts. Cells expressing the Cas mutants also showed decreased amounts of activated Src at focal adhesions. The results suggest that proteins containing ligands for both SH3 and SH2 domains can produce a synergistic activation of Src family kinases.","sh3 domain, tyrosine kinase, cooperativity, src, sh2 domain, focal adhesion, wild type, enzyme"
"Evolutionary structural optimization (ESO) is based on a simple idea that an optimal structure (with maximum stiffness but minimum weight) can be achieved by gradually removing ineffectively used materials from design domain. In general, the results from ESO are likely to be local optimums other than the global optimum desired. In this paper, the genetic algorithm (GA) is integrated with ESO to form a new algorithm called Genetic Evolutionary Structural Optimization (GESO), which takes the advantage of the excellent behavior of the GA in searching for global optimums. For the developed GESO method, each element in finite element analysis is an individual and has its own fitness value according to the magnitude of its sensitivity number. Then, all elements in an initial domain constitute a whole population in GA. After a number of generations, undeleted elements will converge to the optimal result that will be more likely to be a global optimum than that of ESO. To avoid missing the optimum layout of a structure in the evolution, an interim thickness is introduced into GESO and its validity is demonstrated by an example. A stiffness optimization with weight constraints and a weight optimization with displacement constraints are studied as numerical examples to investigate the effectiveness of GESO by comparison with the performance of ESO. It is shown through the examples that the developed GESO method has powerful capacity in searching for global optimal results and requires less computational effort than ESO and other existing methods.","genetic algorithm, evolutionary optimization algorithm, structural optimization, finite element analysis, global optimization, genetics"
"Nitric oxide (NO) is a highly reactive free radical involved in intra- and intercellular signaling in various stages of reproduction. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO donor, on nuclear and cytoplasmic in vitro maturation of bovine oocytes. Analysis of variance was conducted and the means were compared by t test at a level of 5%. Low (10(-7) and 10(-9)M) and intermediate (10(-5)M) concentrations of SNP had no significant effect on nuclear maturation, however, when a greater concentration of SNP (10(-3)M) was added, oocytes remained in metaphase I (MI) after 24 h culture (P<0.05) and did not show cumulus expansion. To evaluate if this effect was reversible and if a retardation or inhibition had occurred in the progression from MI to MII, oocytes were cultured in presence of 10(-3)M of SNP for 24 h followed by culture for an additional 24 h in medium with or without SNP. After 48 h, the oocytes remained in MI even when the medium was changed at 24 h with or without SNP. The kinetics of nuclear maturation was assessed to evaluate if there had been or not a retardation in the progression of meiosis with the concentration of 10(-3)M SNP. This concentration delayed germinal vesicle breakdown (VGBD) at 8 h of culture (P<0.05), and at 12 h there was no significant difference between the control and the treated group. The concentrations that did not induce alterations in nuclear maturation were evaluated for cytoplasmic maturation. The concentration of 10(-5)M improved the percentage of peripheral cortical granules (P<0.05), and significantly increased the percentage of blastocysts. These results demonstrate that SNP at greater concentrations (10(-3)M) has a cytotoxic effect, but at intermediate (10(-5)M) concentrations it increases blastocyst rates. NO exhibits a dual effect on bovine oocytes, inhibits (10(-3)M of SNP) nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation or stimulates (10(-5)M of SNP) cytoplasmic maturation, depending on concentration in the culture medium.","embryo development, kinetics, free radical, nitric oxide, analysis of variance"

"Recent developments in biomedical informatics research have afforded possibilities for great advances in health care delivery. These exciting opportunities also present a number of challenges to the implementation and integration of technologies in the workplace. As in most domains, there is a gulf between technologic artifacts and end users, which compromises the culture of safety in the workplace. Because clinical practice is a human endeavor, there is a need for bridging disciplines to enable clinicians to benefit from rapid technologic advances. This, in turn, necessitates a broadening of disciplinary boundaries to consider cognitive and social factors related to the design and use of technology. The authors argue for a place of prominence for cognitive science in understanding nursing factors associated with patient safety. Cognitive science provides a framework for the analysis and modeling of complex human performance. Studies of clinical cognition can meaningfully inform and shape design, development and assessment of information systems. Furthermore, they have a decisive impact on whether information technology has a positive influence on human performance and are especially important in understanding and promoting safe practices. These issues are discussed in the context of clinical informatics with a focus on nursing practice.","informatics, patient safety, nursing, clinical cognition, decision-making"
"Even though the levels of circulating sex steroid hormones are to a large extent heritable, their genetic determinants are largely unknown. With the advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), much progress has been made and several genetic loci have been identified to be associated with serum levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin. The variants identified so far only explain a small amount of the overall heritability, but may help to elucidate the role of sex steroid hormones in common disorders such as hypogonadism, type 2 diabetes and hormone-sensitive cancers. This review provides an overview of the current state of knowledge of the genetic determinants of sex steroid hormones, with a focus on recent GWAS and brief directions for elucidating the remaining heritability.","dehydroepiandrosterone, estradiol, genome-wide association studies, hypogonadism, sex hormone-binding globulin, testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, genome wide association studies"
"Even, or may be particularly, in the time of disintegration, deregulation and competition in a power system, its reliability is one of the most important criteria which must be taken into consideration during planning and operation phases of its life. In many countries the increase of generating capacity takes place in small units of so-called distributed generation (DG). They use primary energy conventional sources as well as renewable energy sources (RES), and in many cases produce electricity and heat (CHP). Using of renewable energy sources is one of the crucial components of the sustainable development, giving rationale economic, ecological and social effects. Electrical energy sources can be qualified into two groups: with production dependent on unpredictable external sources of primary energy, and others. The most difficult is to analyse those, production of which depends on renewable energy sources like: hydro energy, the Sun, and wind energy. This paper presents chosen aspects of power system reliability modelling and evaluation, including distributed generation.","distributed power generation, power generation reliability, renewable energy sources, distributed generation, power system deregulation, power system disintegration, power system operation, power system planning, power system reliability, electric power system reliability, reliability assessment methodology, electricity, reliability, electric power system, production, sustainable development, power systems, wind energy, renewable energy resources, power system"
"Distributed database theory for a single view of a distributed database consisting of homogeneous relational databases has been known for over a decade. The application of some of this theory in commercial products has not been established. Although some commercial distributed database products support naming and location transparency, these products do not provide full support for fragmentation transparency. Providing support for declaring and reasoning about fragments requires adding data definition capabilities and updating complex query optimizers. This article presents a syntax for the specification of fragmentation and describes a prototype for reasoning about the fragmentation criteria. This prototype examines the feasibility of not having to update the existing query optimizer by taking a distributed SQL query and fragmentation specification and generating a sequence of SQL queries expressed over the fragments, which is then input to the established query optimizer. This article provides a case study of this approach on a commercial distributed database product. A benchmark for distributed databases for decision support, known as D 3 S, is introduced and used in the case study. The study shows that a two-step process of first optimizing with respect to the fragmentation criteria, followed by the existing distributed query optimization, results in performant query evaluation plans.","database system, fragmentation transparency, case study, optimization, distributed database, algorithm, query optimization, decision support, business model, fragmentation, evaluation, transparency, prototype, relational database"
"85 male college students volunteering for service as companions to chronically ill mental patients were compared to a group of 85 control students on a number of psychological tests administered during the students' freshmen years. These tests consisted of the MMPI, EPPS, Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Scale of Values, the Scholastic Aptitude Test, and the Terman Concept Mastery Test. Students taking part in the Companion Program are not differentiated from their control counterparts in any clinical respect. There is evidence that the companions are: (a) slightly more religiously oriented, (b) more morally concerned, (c) more compassionate, and (d) more introverted than the control students.

"This paper introduces a new retailing concept called shopper-based mall equity (SBME). SBME is the differential effect of mall knowledge on shoppers' responses to a mall's marketing activities. The results of a study in two Canadian shopping malls consisting of 905 shoppers who were administered a questionnaire suggest that SBME is a bi-dimensional construct, composing two sub-scales, namely mall awareness and mall image. Further psychometric tests show a parsimonious SBME measure with support for convergent, discriminant and predictive validities. Multi-group latent mean structures show that the SBME measure is able to discriminate shoppers that globally attribute high-mall scores from those who globally attribute low-mall scores. The article includes theoretical and managerial implications.","mall equity, latent mean structures, multi-group cfa, retailing, high-order cfa, predictive validity"
"Understanding the coherence between the attributes of a brand is a key asset for marketers managing brand equity. This study proposes consumer causal maps as a powerful instrument to achieve this purpose. These maps shed light on how different consumer groups think about the brand. Compared to non-owners, brand owners have been able to develop more expertise regarding the specific brand, which leads them to have more extensive causal maps. An exception occurs for the category leader, for which owners and non-owners have equally extensive maps. The surprising finding of this study is that the leading brand seems to encompass the ingredients for the causal maps of the other brands in the category. The results highlight how management should address owners and non-owners differently, in particular if a brand is far from category leadership.","snowboards, brand maps, cognitive structure, expertise, ownership, brand equity"
"We examined methods for verifying whether or not ships have performed mid-ocean ballast water exchange (BWE) on four commercial vessels operating in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. During BWE, a ship replaces the coastal water in its ballast tanks with water drawn from the open ocean, which is considered to harbor fewer organisms capable of establishing in coastal environments. We measured concentrations of several naturally occurring chemical tracers (salinity, six trace elements, colored dissolved organic matter fluorescence and radium isotopes) along ocean transects and in ballast tanks subjected to varying degrees of BWE (0-99%). Many coastal tracers showed significant concentration changes due to BWE, and our ability to detect differences between exchanged and unexchanged ballast tanks was greatest under multivariate analysis. An expanded dataset, which includes additional geographic regions, is now needed to test the generality of our results.","ballast water, biological invasions, radioisotopes, chemical oceanography, verification, optical properties, metals"
"Since plasma is regarded as one of the multifunctional fluids which has high energy density, chemical reactivity, controllability by an external electromagnetic field and variable transport properties such as electrical conductivity, it is considerably effective for the synthesis of nano-particles. Since a radio frequency inductively coupled plasma (RF-ICP) has several advantages, the synthesis of ultrafine powders of metals and ceramics with high purity can be easily achieved by the steep temperature gradients at the tail. In the present study, it is clarified how the number density, diameter and specific surface of the produced nano metal-particles of Al, Ti, Au and Pt are influenced by the operating conditions such as the quenching gas flow rate and the powder feed rate of the RF-ICP reactor by numerical investigation. For all the metals, the increase in the quenching gas flow rate results in the increase in the particle number density, the decrease in the mean diameter and the increase in the specific surface. The increase in the powder feed rate causes the increase in the mean diameter but the decrease in the specific surface. The results of four metals are markedly different from each other due to their own material properties of saturation pressure and surface tension.","nucleation, metals, plasma processing and deposition, nanostructures, inductive coupled plasma, radio frequency, temperature gradient, surface tension, electric conductivity, operant conditioning, electromagnetic field, material properties, plasma processing"
"Based on static tests on MTS and dynamic tests on split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) during the first loading, this study determined the dynamic compressive constitutive relation of metallic Nd. Based on large deformations of metallic Nd specimens generated by the multi-compressive loadings during SHPB tests, and recorded by a high-speed camera, the results of numerical simulations for SHPB test processes were used to extend the determined constitutive relation from small strain to large strain. The shearing instability strain in dynamic compressive deformations of metallic Nd was estimated with the extended constitutive relation according to the criterion given by Batra and Wei, and was compared with the average strain of recovered specimens.","shearing instability, dynamic compression, large deformation, metallic nd, constitutive relation, split hopkinson pressure bar, numerical simulation"
"Twenty-four cases of concomitant Hirschsprung's disease (HD) and neuronal intestinal dysplasia (NID) are presented. The clinical picture is characterized by the early and acute onset of HD symptoms. The diagnosis is established by means of rectal and colonic biopsies. Open biopsies during laparotomy should be taken without injury to the mucosa. Early surgical therapy consists of extended resection of the aganglionic segment and the colon affected by NID up to the splenic flexure. Complications are imminent if the aganglionosis masks the symptoms of NID and, accordingly, only the aganglionic segment is resected. As an alternative, postponed resection of the aganglionic segment alone is proposed once the NID-affected bowel develops functional maturation. In children who do not show an improvement of colon dysmotility, however, extended resection is recommended at the age of 4 years. In follow-up studies of colon motility, functional colon sonography is used.","diagnostic, hirschsprung's disease, colon sonography, neuronal intestinal dysplasia, colon motility, colon biopsy"
"We report the first study of the optical conductivity of MgB2 covering the range of its lowest-energy superconducting gap. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy is utilized to determine the complex, frequency-dependent conductivity sigma(omega) of thin films. The imaginary part reveals an inductive response due to the emergence of the superconducting condensate. The real part exhibits a strong depletion of oscillator strength near 5 meV resulting from the opening of a superconducting energy gap. The gap ratio of 2Delta0/k(B)TC approximately 1.9 is well below the weak-coupling value, pointing to complex behavior in this novel superconductor.","oscillations, terahertz, far infrared, density of state, thin film, superconductors, kramers kronig, energy gap"
"This paper describes an experimental study on exposed-type column bases with new restoring force characteristics. Generally, an exposed-type column base consists of elastic/plastic anchor bolts and an elastic thick base plate. The restoring force characteristics of these column bases are observed to be slip-type due to the gap between the nut of the anchor bolt and the base plate, caused by the plastic elongation of the anchor bolt. These restoring force characteristics can be governed by elastic/plastic anchor bolts, an elastic/plastic base plate and/or a gap between the nut and the base plate. In particular, the gap between the nut and the base plate can be eliminated by means of a new device consisting of a wedge compressed by a spring and a counter-wedge. To show the fundamental characteristics of the new column base, two kinds of specimens were tested. The conclusions obtained are as follows. (1) The cyclic characteristics of conventional column bases with elastic/plastic anchor bolts and an elastic base plate became slip-type. (2) The cyclic characteristics of column bases with the gap between nut and base plate eliminated by use of the device became non-slip-type, that is, linear from the origin at each loading step.","new device, experimental testing, restoring force characteristics, column base"
"The rate of spontaneous regression in CIN III lesions is controversial. Whereas some studies have reported high regression rates of up to 38 % after prolonged biopsy-conus intervals, others have shown rates between 0 and 4 % without considering time intervals. Identification of young patients with potentially regressing CIN III could offer the chance to avoid conisation, thus lowering the risk of preterm labour.To further clarify the facts, we retrospectively compared 635 biopsies showing CIN III with the diagnosis of the conisation. Either regression (CIN I or less) or non-regression (CIN II and higher) was recorded. Diagnoses were made by light microscopy and p16 immunostaining.Conisation was performed between 2 and 463 days after biopsy (median 8.9 weeks). Six hundred twenty one (98 %) were HPV-HR positive. In 345 cases, HPV subtyping was available, showing HPV16 infection in 57 %. Routine processing of the conisation tissue showed no corresponding CIN lesion (< CIN II) in 40 cases (6.3 %). Additional step sectioning of the tissue revealed small CIN II+ lesions in 80 %. Finally, eight cases (1.3 %) fulfilled the criteria of regression. No regression was seen in HPV16 positive cases. Twelve invasive carcinomas were detected by routine processing of the conisation tissue.These results are in contrast with some prior reports that might have overestimated spontaneous regression of CIN III. Study size and an accurate discrimination between CIN II and CIN III lesions by histopathology seem to be the most likely factors to explain the diverging results published. Complete step sectioning of the whole tissue is also mandatory in questionable cases. Although theories exist that the initial biopsy might stimulate the immune system, thus triggering regression within weeks, our data do not substantially support such a mechanism. Overall, the chance of a CIN III lesion to regress rapidly within weeks or months after diagnosis seems to be small. We found more previously undetected invasive cancer than we observed regression. Therefore, a change in the current policy to treat CIN III lesions is unwarranted.","medical microbiology, internal medicine, parasitology, tropical medicine"
"Although abnormalities of neural circuits involving the cortex, striatum, and thalamus are hypothesized to underlie Tourette's disorder, the neuronal abnormalities within components of these circuits are unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the cellular neurochemistry within these circuits in Tourette's disorder using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, a method that has not previously been used in neurobiological investigations of the disorder.Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging examinations were conducted in 25 males with Tourette's disorder (age 10.9 +/- 2.0 years) and 32 male comparison subjects (age 11.5 +/- 2.7 years). Spectra from frontal cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen, and thalamus were analyzed, and N-acetylaspartate, creatine, choline, myoinositol, and glutamate + glutamine were quantified and compared between the groups.Patients with Tourette's disorder demonstrated a reduction in N-acetylaspartate and choline in the left putamen, along with reduced levels of creatine bilaterally in the putamen. In the frontal cortex, patients had significantly lower concentrations of N-acetylaspartate bilaterally, lower levels of creatine on the right side, and reduced myoinositol on the left side.The results of this study suggest compromised neuronal integrity and deficits in density of neuronal and nonneuronal cells in components of the neural circuits implicated in Tourette's disorder.","magnetic resonance spectroscopy, thalamus, tourette's disorder, basal ganglia, motor cortex, metabolism, neurology, choline, laterality, brain mapping, psychiatry, spectroscopy, nino, macho, neuropsychology, central nervous system, chemistry"
"We present a systematic study of external optical feedback effects on the output characteristics of the two orthogonally polarized modes in a frequency locking dual frequency laser. Accompanied by the change of the external cavity length, the length of the resonance cavity is changed very slowly to set the oscillating modes sweeping across the laser gain curve. Comprehensive results are obtained and a strong mode competition is observed. Particularly, when the laser runs in the middle region of the gain curve, which mode can oscillate is determined by the movement direction of the external feedback mirror. Based on the phenomenon, a displacement sensor with directional discrimination is proposed and its capability is also discussed.","displacement sensor, optical feedback, frequency locking, directional discrimination, mode competition, oscillations"
"Hydatid disease, a worldwide zoonosis, is caused by the larval stage of the Echinococcus tapeworm. Although it can involve almost every organ of the body, lung involvement follows in frequency the hepatic infestation in adults and is the predominating site in children. Radiologically, hydatidosis usually demonstrates typical findings, but many patients are at risk of developing various complications of hydatid disease with atypical imaging findings and these are rarely described in the literature. In this pictorial review, the imaging features of local complications of hydatid disease involving the thorax including intrapulmonary or pleural rupture, infection of the ruptured cysts, reactions of the adjacent tissues, thoracic wall invasion and iatrogenic involvement of pleura are described. Additionally, imaging characteristics of transdiaphragmatic thoracic involvement of hepatic hydatid disease are presented. To prevent the development of subsequent catastrophic results, all radiologists need to be aware of the atypical imaging appearances of complications of pulmonary hydatid disease.","x-ray tomography, lung, complications, pulmonary hydatidosis, thorax, radiography, computed, image features"
"As nursing has developed as a profession there has been a continual evolution of the scope of practice in which nurses work. Emergency nursing practice is an example where recently there has been a rapid expansion in the nature and scope of practice. This change in practice has largely resulted from increasing public demand on emergency departments, medical and nursing shortages and governmental pressure to reduced emergency department waiting times and patient length of stay. There have been a number of models worldwide in which the expansion of the Emergency Nurses role has occurred. Recently in New South Wales the Clinical Initiative Nurse role has been developed as an advanced practice role with the objective of initiating treatment based on advanced clinical assessment and to assist emergency departments to meet benchmarks and key performance indicators (KPIs). The scope of practice of this new role did not extend to that of a Nurse Practitioner who is able to discharge patients, prescribe medication and provide medical referral. The variation in advance practice nursing roles in Australia and worldwide has contributed to confusion and uncertainty. The aim of this paper is to explore the various advanced practice roles that may be encountered in emergency nursing practice and examine some of the advantages and limitations to the implementation of these roles.","emergency nursing, nurse practitioner, clinical initiative nurse, advanced practice"
"Twelve large-scale slab specimens and twenty-two companion push-out specimens were tested to study the behavior and capacity of composite slab joists consisting of cold-formed steel C-sections and concrete. Four shear transfer mechanisms, including surface bond, pre-fabricated bent-up tabs, pre-drilled holes, and self-drilling screws, were employed on the surface of the flange embedded in the concrete to provide shear transfer capacity. Results indicated that specimens employed with shear transfer enhancements showed a marked increase in strength and reduced deflection compared with those relying only on a natural bond between steel and concrete to resist shear. Of the three shear transfer enhancements investigated, bent-up tabs provided the best performance at both the strength and serviceability limit states, followed by drilled holes in the embedded flanges. The use of self-drilling screws resulted in the lowest strength increase. The correlation of shear transfer capacity of push-out specimens with the ultimate capacity of large-scale specimens indicated that the average experimental flexural capacity of the slab specimens was approximately 1.16 times the average predicted value based on push-out test results.","large-scale test, flexural capacity, bent-up tabs, cold-formed, screws, light gage, push-out test, drilled holes, composite"
"To determine whether the sizes and volumes of the posterior fossa structures are abnormal in non-mentally retarded autistic adolescents and adults.Volume measurements of the cerebellum, vermis, and brainstem were obtained from coronal magnetic resonance imaging scans in 16 autistic subjects and 19 group-matched healthy controls. For the purpose of comparison with previous studies, area measurements of the midbrain, pons, medulla, total cerebellar vermis, and its three subregions were also obtained from a larger sample of 22 autistic males (mean age: 22.4 years; range: 12.2-51.8 years) and 22 individually matched controls (mean age 22.4 years; range: 12.9-52.2 years).The total volume of the cerebellum and the cerebellar hemispheres were significantly larger in the autistic subjects with and without correcting for total brain volume. Volumes of the vermis and the brainstem and all area measurements did not differ significantly between groups.There is an increase in the volume of the cerebellum in people with autism consistent with the increase in regional and total brain size reported in this developmental disorder. This finding is also concordant with evidence of cerebellar abnormalities from neuropathological and neuropsychological studies that point to the role of this structure, as part of a complex neural system, in the pathophysiology of autism.","brainstem, autism, magnetic resonance imaging, vermis, cerebellum, mental retardation, magnetic resonance image"
"Consider an infinite sequence of independent, uniformly chosen points from \([0,1]^d\). After looking at each point in the sequence, an overseer is allowed to either keep it or reject it, and this choice may depend on the locations of all previously kept points. However, the overseer must keep at least one of every two consecutive points. We call a sequence generated in this fashion a two-thinning sequence. Here, the purpose of the overseer is to control the discrepancy of the empirical distribution of points, that is, after selecting n points, to reduce the maximal deviation of the number of points inside any axis-parallel hyper-rectangle of volume A from nA. Our main result is an explicit low complexity two-thinning strategy which guarantees discrepancy of \(O(\log ^{2d+1} n)\) for all n with high probability [compare with \(\Theta (\sqrt{n\log \log n})\) without thinning]. The case \(d=1\) of this result answers a question of Benjamini. We also extend the construction to achieve the same asymptotic bound for (\(1+\beta \))-thinning, a set-up in which rejecting is only allowed with probability \(\beta \) independently for each point. In addition, we suggest an improved and simplified strategy which we conjecture to guarantee discrepancy of \(O(\log ^{d+1} n)\) [compare with \(\theta (\log ^d n)\), the best known construction of a low discrepancy sequence]. Finally, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence for our conjecture, and provide simulations supporting the viability of our construction for applications.","Two-choices, Thinning, Discrepancy, Subsampling, Online, Haar, 68W27, 60D05, 60G55"
"A previously published survey has evaluated the natural history and clinical outcome of fetal diaphragmatic. hernia (CDH) in 94 cases. This study showed that the prenatal diagnosis is accurate, the mortality is high (80%), and polyhydramnios is a prenatal predictor of poor clinical outcome. As a follow-up study, 38 consecutive cases of CDH diagnosed in utero were evaluated and treated by the same surgical team. This permitted detailed assessment of prognostic factors and evaluation of the impact of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) on outcome. We found the following. (1) Survival is poor despite optimal postnatal therapy including ECMO. (2) Polyhydramnios is both a common prenatal marker for CDH (present in 69% of fetuses) and a predictor for poor clinical outcome (only 18% survival), but tends to occur after the second trimester. (3) Amniocentesis is indicated to rule out chromosomal abnormalities that were present in 16% of fetuses. (4) All 14 fetuses diagnosed prior to 25 weeks' gestation died. Improved postnatal therapy or surgical intervention before birth will be necessary to salvage the CDH fetus with an early gestational diagnosis or associated polyhydramnios.","lung transplantation, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, fetal surgery, prenatal diagnosis, ultrasound"
"Abstract The first goal of this paper is to empirically explore the relationships between existing object - oriented coupling, cohesion, and inheritance measures and the probability of fault detection in system classes during testing In other words, we wish to better understand the relationship between existing design measurement in OO systems and the quality of the  software  developed The  second  goal  is  to  propose  an  investigation  and  analysis strategy  to  make  these  kind  of  studies  more  repeatable  and  comparable,  a  problem which is pervasive in the literature on quality measurement Results show that many of the  measures  capture  similar  dimensions  in  the  data  set,  thus  reflecting  the  fact  that many of them are based on similar principles and hypotheses However, it is shown that by using a subset of measures, accurate models can be built to predict which classes contain most of the existing faults When predicting fault - prone classes, the best model shows a percentage of correct classifications higher than 80% and finds more than 90% of faulty classes Besides the size of classes, the frequency of method invocations and the depth of inheritance hierarchies seem to be the main driving factors of fault prone - ness","measurement, empirical validation, object-oriented system, cohesion, design measure, coupling, inheritance, software quality, object-oriented, metrics, fault detection, object oriented, software development"
"The advent of therapeutic mRNAs significantly increases the possibilities of protein-based biologics beyond those that can be synthesized by recombinant technologies (eg, monoclonal antibodies, extracellular enzymes, and cytokines). In addition to their application in the areas of vaccine development, immune-oncology, and protein replacement therapies, one exciting possibility is to use therapeutic mRNAs to program undesired, diseased cells to synthesize a toxic intracellular protein, causing cells to self-destruct. For this approach to work, however, methods are needed to limit toxic protein expression to the intended cell type. Here, we show that inclusion of microRNA target sites in therapeutic mRNAs encoding apoptotic proteins, Caspase or PUMA, can prevent their expression in healthy hepatocytes while triggering apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.","RNA modifications, mRNA, miRNA, suicide therapy, therapeutic"
"The morphology, optical properties and wettability of polystyrene (PS) photonic crystals (PC) films were studied under UV irradiation. The hydrophilic carbonyl group formed on the surface of PS microsphere after UV irradiation, which was demonstrated by characterizing the chemical composition of the surface using FTIR. Scanning electron microscopic images show that the PS sphere would contract, deform and melt companying with longer time of UV irradiation. The in situ reflectance and transmittance spectra indicated that the PC film could preserve good optical properties and changed from hydrophobic to hydrophilic in 20 min of UV irradiation. Therefore, the hydrophilic polymer PC film with good optical properties can be obtained by controlling the UV irradiation time, which will be of great importance for the application of PC in the special system.","Photochemical cross-linking, Photonic crystal, Polystyrene, UV irradiation, Wettability"
"3,6-Connected cyclohexadienes as precursors for polyphenylenes are synthesized and characterized by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. Pure fractions of trimers, hexamers, and nonamers are collected after separation of the product mixture by recycling GPC. The anticipated formation of rigid linear structures, due to the trans-configuration of the monomeric units, is supported by density functional theory and experimentally confirmed by dynamic light scattering from dilute solution at low scattering angles. The obtained translational diffusion coefficients are represented by rigid rod-like or prolate ellipsoid-like molecular shapes. The measurements of diffusion coefficients reveal a length-dependent ratio of 1:2:3 between the three oligomers, which directly correlates to the expected length extension from trimer to nonamer.","density functional theory (dft), dynamic light scattering (dls), poly(para-phenylene), rigid oligomers"
"Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activates two distinct signaling pathways inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines or type I interferons (IFNs), respectively. MyD88 and TIRAP/Mal are essential adaptor molecules for the former but not for the latter pathway. In contrast, TRIF/TICAM-1 and TRAM/TICAM-2 are essential for both. TIRAP is a sorting adaptor molecule recruiting MyD88 to activated TLR4 in the plasma membrane. TRAM is thought to bridge between TLR4 and TRIF by physical association. Little is known, however, how TRAM interacts with TLR4 or with TRIF during LPS response. Here, we show that TRAM recruits TRIF to the plasma membrane. Moreover, LPS induces upregulation of TLR4-association with TRAM and their subsequent translocation into endosome/lysosome. The internalized signaling complex consisting of TLR4 and TRAM colocalizes with TRAF3, a signaling molecule downstream of TRIF, in endosome/lysosome. These results suggest that TLR4 activates TRIF-signaling in endosome/lysosome after relocation from the cell surface.","interferon, toll-like receptor, lipopolysaccharide, innate immunity, proinflammatory cytokine, signaling pathway"
"This paper compares the quality characteristics of a large legacy software system and a new one. Defect fixes applied to specific modules during testing are used as the direct quality metric. Indirect quality indicators used in this paper include software metrics of various product and process attributes, including design, size, change, and complexity. We analyze and compare the measurement results by examining their individual distributions, the correlations between defects and quality indicators, and tree-based models linking defects to quality indicators. In both these systems, most of the defects are found to be concentrated on relatively few high-defect modules, which points to the need for appropriate risk identification techniques so that defect removal effort can be focused on those high-defect modules for effective quality improvement. In addition, defects in the legacy system are more closely related to change and data complexity metrics; while defects in the new system are more closely related to various design metrics. These results demonstrate different measurement characteristics for these two types of software systems, and suggest that different quality analysis and improvement methods may be more appropriate and effective for different kinds of software systems.","large software systems, software metrics, defect, legacy software system, defect characteristic, statistical analysis, tree-based modeling, software systems, legacy software, software metric, legacy system, quality improvement"
"In this paper, a tradeoff between the total energy consumption-per-bit and the end-to-end rate under spatial reuse in wireless multi-hop network is developed and analyzed. The end-to-end rate of the network is the number of information bits transmitted (end-to-end) per channel use by any node in the network that is forwarding the data. In order to increase the bandwidth efficiency, spatial reuse is considered whereby simultaneous relay transmissions are allowed provided there is a minimum separation between such transmitters. The total energy consumption-per-bit includes the energy transmitted and the energy consumed by the receiver to process (demodulate and decoder) the received signal. The total energy consumption-per-bit is normalized by the distance between a source-destination pair in order to be consistent with a direct (single-hop) communication network. Lower bounds on this energy-bandwidth tradeoff are analyzed using convex optimization methods. For a given location of relays, it is shown that the total energy consumption-per-bit is minimized by optimally selecting the end-to-end rate. It is also demonstrated that spatial reuse can improve the bandwidth efficiency for a given total energy consumption-per-bit. However, at the rate that minimizes the total energy consumption-per-bit, spatial reuse does not provide lower energy consumption-per-bit compared to the case without spatial reuse. This is because spatial reuse requires more receiver energy consumption at a given end-to-end rate. Such degraded energy efficiency can be compensated by varying the minimum separation of hops between simultaneous transmitters. In the case of equi-spaced relays, analytical results for the energy-bandwidth tradeoff are provided and it is shown that the minimum energy consumption-per-bit decreases linearly with the end-to-end distance.","optimization, convex optimization, spread spectrum communication, interference, bandwidth"
"In recent years, the influence of design patterns on software quality has attracted an increasing attention in the area of software engineering, as design patterns encapsulate valuable knowledge to resolve design problems, and more importantly to improve design quality. As the paradigm continues to increase in popularity, a systematic and objective approach to verify the design of a pattern is increasingly important. The intent session in a design pattern indicates the problem the design pattern wants to resolve, and the solution session describes the structural model for the problem. When the problem in the intent is a quality problem, the structure model should provide a solution to improve the relevant quality. In this work we provide an approach, based on object-oriented quality model, to validate if a design pattern is well-designed, i.e., it answers the question of the proposed structural model really resolves the quality problems described in the intent. We propose a validation approach to help pattern developers check if a design pattern is well-designed. In addition, a quantitative method is proposed to measure the effectiveness of the quality improvement of a design pattern that pattern users can determine which design patterns are applicable to meet their functional and quality requirements.","relevant quality, design quality, design pattern, object-oriented metrics, quality improvement, object-oriented quality model, pattern user, design problem, quality problem, quantitative approach, quality requirement, pattern developer, software quality, software engineering, object oriented, quantitative method"
"The problem of designing a linear predetection filter for the detection of a sampled random signal in additive noise is considered. The design of the filter is based on an optimality criterion which maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio enhancement. The optimum weighting function obtained in this manner has the advantage that it is independent of signal characteristics and depends only on the covariance function of the noise. The optimum filter, for general covariance functions, is obtained forN = 2, 3and4samples. The asymptotic solution for largeNis also presented by employing results from the theory of Teeplitz forms. In addition, the complete solution for allNis given for several particular covariance matrices. An application of the results is made to the problem of designing a linear predetection filter in a moving target indication (MTI) radar system. The optimum weighting function forN = 2is a single-cancellation unit, while that forN = 3is similar but not quite the same as a double-cancellation unit. It is shown that the signal-to-noise ratio enhancement provided by the double-cancellation scheme is1.76db worse than that of the optimum filter when the noise has a Gaussian covariance function.","optimum weighting, general covariance function, signal-to-noise ratio enhancement, gaussian covariance function, linear predetection filter, particular covariance matrix, optimum filter, additive noise, optimum weighting function forn, covariance function, information theory, weight function, signal processing, testing, covariance matrix, filtering, signal detection, signal to noise ratio"
"Efforts to develop a managerially meaningful alternative to the neoclassical theory of the firm have always been an important part of theory development in marketing. This paper argues that the main explanandum of a managerial theory of the firm is performance differentials between firms. Marketing shares an interest in explaining performance differentials with strategic management and organizational economics. We show that a generic understanding of the sources of performance differentials is emerging across these three disciplines, and we incorporate this understanding in a unifying conceptual framework that is both managerially relevant and embedded in economic theory. We discuss market orientation literature in light of this framework, and present the prospects for developing it into an actionable view of how marketing can contribute to the success of the firm.","marketing strategy, organizational economics, competitive advantage, strategic management, marketing theory, market share, theory of the firm, conceptual framework"
"The vaginal mucosa is the most common site of initiation of virus infections that are transmitted through heterosexual intercourse, including HIV and papillomavirus. Thus, in order to prevent or treat these infections, strong vaginal immunity is required as the first line of defense. In this study, to establish a less invasive, safe, convenient and effective immunization method, we examined the local (skin and vagina) gene transfection efficiency of a non-needle jet injector for daily insulin injection. In the skin experiment, the needle-free injector resulted in a marked increase in marker gene expression, compared to the conventional needle-syringe injection. In addition, intradermal DNA vaccination using the needle-free injector dramatically induced IFN-gamma and antibody systemic responses in mice. Furthermore, we investigated the applicability of the needle-free injector as a vaginal vaccination tool in rabbits. Vaginal gene expression using the needle-free injector was significantly greater than that using needle-syringe injection. Moreover, intravaginal vaccination by the needle-free injector promoted vaginal IgA secretion and IFN-gamma mRNA expression in the blood lymphocytes, to a degree significantly higher than that by needle-syringe injection. In conclusion, local vaginal DNA vaccination using a needle-free jet injector is a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of mucosal infectious diseases.","cellular immunity, local humoral immunity, needle-free injector, vaginal dna vaccine, dna vaccine, immune response, gene expression"
The purpose of the study was to illuminate the meanings of the lived experiences of support as disclosed by fathers of children with congenital heart defect (CHD). Narrative interviews were conducted individually with five fathers of children diagnosed with CHD. A phenomenological-hermeneutic method was used to interpret the verbatim transcribed narrative interviews. The meanings of the lived experiences of support for the fathers were identified in two themes and illustrate the fathers' feelings of being supported when being in a mutual relationship with others. A third theme illustrates the situation when support is absent. Our findings indicate that support for fathers of children with CHD might be best promoted by the philosophy of family-centered care.,"congenital heart defects, family-centered care, fathers, phenomenological-hermeneutic, support, nursing"
"Two siblings are presented in whom a recognized syndrome of functional small-bowel obstruction with malrotation and short small-bowel was diagnosed. The previously described association with pyloric stenosis was not present in our cases. They do, however, support the view that this syndrome has an autosomal recessive model of inheritance. A deficiency of argyrophil neurones in the myenteric plexus has been noted in this syndrome but more precise neurohistochemical studies are required to define the exact deficit involved.","short bowel, argyrophil neurones, function small-bowel obstruction, malrotation"
"General closed-form solutions of distributional differential equations of the elastic flexural-torsional buckling of monosymmetric, constant-section, thin-walled members fitted with discrete elastic bracings over their length and subjected to compression and bending in their symmetry plane have been worked out. The bracings confine the warping and displacements of the intermediate sections of the members from their symmetry plane. Besides the general case, members with a prescribed axis of rotation are considered. Particular solutions of spatial stability problems for members optionally supported at their ends have been worked out on the basis of the general solutions. The practical application of the presented solutions, incorporated into appropriate computer programs, is illustrated with numerical examples in which the effect of the particular bracings on the critical load of the flexural-torsional buckling of columns or that of the lateral buckling of steel structural beams is investigated. The theoretical solutions have been validated experimentally by the author's own tests on laterally and longitudinally braced steel columns and by Milner's tests on laterally braced beams [24] .","discrete elastic bracing, lateral buckling, test, steel structure, flexural-torsional buckling, open thin-walled member, compression and bending, closed form solution, axis of rotation, differential equation"
"Sulfites are chemical substances that are used widely in the pharmaceutical industry to reduce or prevent oxidation. Sodium metabisulfite (Na 2 S 2 O 5 ) is still present in several parenteral amino acid solutions. Since intravenous lipid emulsions are contaminated by hydroperoxides, we evaluated whether metabisulfite had an antioxidant activity against hydroperoxides. In vitro , Na 2 S 2 O 5 inhibited the oxidant activity of H 2 O 2 , tert -butyl-, and cumene hydroperoxides. The antioxidant capacity of metabisulfite was supported in vivo by the lower (P < 0.01) excretion of malondialdehyde, a stable end product of lipid peroxidation, in babies receiving metabisulfite in their parenteral nutrition. However, for concentrations outside the range found in solutions for parenteral nutrition, the reduction of hydroperoxides by Na 2 S 2 O 5 could transform this compound into an oxidant, like a sulfite radical. It is suggested that metabisulfite has antiperoxide properties that, under specific conditions, contribute to the generation of toxic oxidants.","thiobarbituric acid, malondialdehyde, parenteral nutrition, hydroperoxides, horseradish peroxidase, hpo, reactive oxygen species, tbh, mda, tert -butyl hydroperoxide, tba, tpn, metabisulfite, antioxidant, total parenteral nutrition"
"When a colour/orientation conjunction search display is immediately preceded by a display that shows either the colour or the orientation of each upcoming search item, search is faster after colour-preview than after orientation-preview. One explanation for this feature asymmetry is that colour has priority access to attentional selection relative to features such as orientation and size. In support of this hypothesis, we show that this asymmetry persists even after colour and orientation feature search performance is equated. However, this notion was ruled out by our subsequent experiments in which the target was defined by conjunction of colour and size; colour-preview was less helpful than size-preview (even though colour-feature search was faster than size-feature search, for these feature values). A final set of experiments tested size-preview vs. orientation-preview for size/orientation conjunction search, using stimuli for which orientation-feature search was easier than size-feature search. Size-preview produced much faster search than orientation-preview, demonstrating again that ease of feature search does not predict effects of a feature-preview. Overall, size produced the most facilitation when presented as a feature-preview (for both colour/size and size/orientation conjunctions), followed by colour (for colour/orientation conjunction but not for colour/size conjunction) and then orientation (which never facilitated search). Whilst each feature-preview may potentially facilitate search, the transition from feature-preview display to search display could disrupt search processes, because of luminance and/or colour changes. We see evidence for some sort of disruption when the feature-preview slows search. An explanation of this set of results must focus on both facilitation and disruption: these effects are not mutually exclusive, and neither suffices alone, since performance after feature-preview can be significantly better or significantly worse than conjunction baseline.","colour, progressive disclosure, orientation, conjunction search, preview, attention, feature-preview, feature search, selection, size"
"Chiral gamma-aryloxybutenolides, readily accessible through dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) of racemic acyloxybutenolides, were utilized as ""chiral aldehyde"" building blocks for intermolecular cycloadditions and Michael reactions. Unprecedented selectivity in trimethylenemethane cycloadditions with this building block allowed an efficient synthesis of a novel metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 antagonist in development by the Bayer corporation. These studies further inspired work that culminated in the total synthesis of (+)-brefeldin A, a natural product with a range of significant biological properties. All of the stereochemistry in this target molecule was derived from two palladium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation reactions. The trans-alkenes were synthesized by a Julia olefination and a ruthenium-catalyzed trans-hydrosilylation-protodesilylation protocol. The route to (+)-brefeldin A lends itself to analogue syntheses and was completed in 18 steps in 6 % overall yield.","biological activity, asymmetric synthesis, total synthesis, alkylation"
"Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) assays are widely used to screen for coagulation disorders and to monitor administration of therapeutic drugs. The analysis of data from coagulation assays has traditionally concentrated on determination of clot times (for APTT and PT) and magnitude of signal change during coagulation (e.g. for PT-based fibrinogen quantitation). The purpose of this study was to determine if the diagnostic power of these assays could be increased by using neural networks to interpret multiple parameters from these assays. Error back-propagation neural networks were trained using multiple variables derived from APTT and PT optical data for 200 normal and abnormal patient specimens. These networks were used to: (1) classify samples as either deficient or non-deficient with respect to individual blood components; and (2) estimate the approximate concentration of specific coagulation factors. Results indicated that these networks could be successfully trained to identify specific factor deficiencies at less than 30% normal levels with good specificity and variable sensitivity, but that they estimated actual concentrations poorly in most cases. These results support possible applications for neural networks identifying specific coagulation abnormalities from non-specific APTT and PT assays using expanded data parameter sets.","pt, clot signature, artificial intelligence, aptt, optical clot profile, neural network, error back propagation, artificial intelligent"
"Diacylglycerol (DG) and triacylglycerol (TG) levels in rat lung tissue were determined from day 17 of gestation to day 10 post partum and studied in parallel with ultrastructural differentiation. The DG level, although rather low at all measured stages, rose significantly between days 17 and 19 and at birth. TG level increased steadily during the whole studied period and especially between days 17 and 19 and at birth. In DG as well as in TG, saturated fatty acids were predominant. The rising of TG levels paralleled the appearance and accumulation of lipid vacuoles in mesodermal cells lying in contact with type II cells. The possible role of these cells is discussed.","Lipid, Triacylglycerol, Lung Tissue, Saturated Fatty Acid, Post Partum"
"The application of information technology (IT) in health care has the potential to transform the delivery of care, as well as the health care work environment, by streamlining processes, making procedures more accurate and efficient, and reducing the risk of human error. For nurses, a major aspect of this transformation is the refocusing of their work on direct patient care and away from being a conduit of information and communication among departments. Several of the technologies discussed, such as physician order entry and bar code technology, have existed for years as standalone systems. Many others are just being developed and are being integrated into complex clinical information systems (CISs) with clinical decision support at their core. While early evaluation of these systems shows positive outcome measurements, financial, technical, and organizational hurdles to widespread implementation still remain. One major issue is defining the role nurses, themselves, will play in the selection and implementation of these systems as they become more steeped in the knowledge of nursing informatics. Other challenges revolve around issues of job satisfaction and the attraction and retention of nursing staff in the midst of a serious nursing shortage. Despite these concerns, it is expected that, in the long run, the creation of an electronic work environment with systems that integrate all functions of the health care team will positively impact cost-effectiveness, productivity, and patient safety while helping to revitalize nursing practice.","information technology, human error, nursing informatics, clinical decision support, cost effectiveness, health care, job satisfaction"

"We report a series of four spinal cord-injured children with ventilator dependency who were implanted with radiofrequency phrenic nerve pacers. At injury, their ages ranged from 6 to 9 years. Implantation occurred from 15 to 47 months following injury. The longest term of pacing has been 59 months. One patients, who was being paced full-time, died suddently at 32 months of a viral myocarditis. Two patients underwent bipolar phrenic implantation in the neck, while two other patients underwent bilateral thoracotomy with monopolar electrode implantation in the mediastinum. There have been no complications related to pacer dysfunction in the postoperative course. Selective pacing schedules have been developed to minimize problems related with external mechanical ventilation. Radiofrequency phrenic nerve pacing is of value in the complete rehabilitative management of these severely disabled children.","cervical spinal cord injury, electrophrenic respiration, mechanical ventilation, phrenic nerve pacing"
"Loss of genetic material, including loss of loci on chromosome arms 6q, 9p, and 10q, occurs frequently in cutaneous melanoma but infrequently in benign melanocytic nevi or other melanocytic lesions, suggesting that these genetic alterations are important in the development and progression of melanoma. To examine whether allelic loss is of prognostic importance in melanoma, disease-free survival was related to loss of heterozygosity on 6q, 9p and 10q in 83 individuals with sporadic primary cutaneous melanoma. Loss of chromosome arms 6q and 10q were each significantly associated with a poorer clinical outcome (P=0.013 and P=0.001 respectively). In a subgroup of 41 subjects whose primary tumours were allelotyped, the fractional allelic loss (FAL) at 39 autosomal arms also significantly correlated with disease-free survival (P=0.013), with an increase in FAL associated with a poorer outcome; this association remained significant when controlled for tumour thickness (P=0.035). In addition, a greater proportion of cells were immunopositive for Ki67 antigen, p53 and p21WAF1 protein in the primary melanomas than in the benign melanocytic nevi, however, only p53 over-expression was significantly associated with improved survival (P=0.041).","ONC, oncogenes, cancer, apoptosis, tumor suppressor genes, tumor viruses, molecular oncology, cell cycle, growth factors, growth factor receptors, growth regulatory genes"
