"It has been shown previously that a mixed-radix converter can be modified to perform all the essential functions of an error checker for error detection and correction in residue number system hardware architectures. Since the computations in a mixed-radix converter are themselves done in residue arithmetic, error checking by means of mixed-radix conversion also checks for errors that occur in the hardware of the mixed-radix converter. The potentially useful properties of this self-checking error checker are examined","digital arithmetic, digital filters, error correction, error detection, pipeline processing, arithmetic coding, digital filters, error correction, error detection, mixed radix conversion, pipelined array, residue number error checkers, self checking properties"
"Design and numerical investigations of cold-formed steel channel columns with inclined edge stiffeners are presented in this paper. The edge stiffeners of the channel sections consisted of simple lips that inclined at different angles both outwards and inwards. Finite el ement analysis was used in the numerical investigation. A non-linear finite element model was developed and verified against fixed-ended column tests. Geometric and material non-linearities were included in the finite element model. It is shown that the finite element model closely predicted the experimental ultimate loads of the cold-formed steel channel columns with inclined edge stiffeners. Hence, the model was used for a parametric study of cross-section geometries. The column strengths predicted by the finite element analysis were compared with the design column strengths calculated using the American and Australian/New Zealand specifications for cold-formed steel structures. The design rules in the American and Australian/New Zealand specifications for designing an edge-stiffened element are mainly based on tests of channels with simple edge stiffeners perpendicular to the flanges. However, these specifications allow the design of inclined edge stiffeners that are purely intuitive. It is shown that the design column strengths calculated from the specifications are generally conservative for cold-formed steel channel columns with inclined edge stiffeners.","edge stiffeners, channels, steel structures, fixed-ended columns, design strengths, cold-formed steel, buckling, structural design, cross section, finite element model, finite element analysis, design rules"
"A new target recognition algorithm based on the combination of radar and acoustic sensors is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the velocity, the first dominant frequency and the second dominant frequency of the target are taken as effective characteristics, and then the expression of the basic probability assignment function for the target character is obtained though fuzzy inference. Secondly, D-S evidential reasoning is applied to the combination of characteristics to get the reliable recognition of the target. Lastly, simulation is performed on the new algorithm, and the simulation results prove the algorithm is effective.","acoustic sensor, d-s evidential reasoning, fuzzy inference, radar, target recognition, sensor fusion, radar imaging, intelligent control, object recognition, radar sensor, case based reasoning, velocity, automatic control, simulation, fuzzy control, frequency, probability"
"This research examines the moderating effects public policy has on relationship strength in a relationship marketing context. Prior research suggests that many positive outcomes emerge from forming inter-firm relationships, yet few examine potential negative outcomes such as anti-competitive behavior. This paper examines what happens to both positive and negative outcomes, when close inter-firm relationships are regulated directly by public policy. It is found that regulations intended to protect consumers and small retailers from anti-competitive behavior are effective in reducing the negative outcomes of such behavior, yet they simultaneously have an unintended effect of dampening the positive outcomes that close inter-firm relationships provide.","vertical integration, relationship marketing, price discrimination, public policy"
"The purpose of this study was to observe the effects of changing the grain (the first level of spatial resolution possible with a given data set) and extent (the total area of the study) of landscape data on observed spatial patterns and to identify some general rules for comparing measures obtained at different scales. Simple random maps, maps with contagion (i.e., clusters of the same land cover type), and actual landscape data from USGS land use (LUDA) data maps were used in the analyses. Landscape patterns were compared using indices measuring diversity (H), dominance (D) and contagion (C). Rare land cover types were lost as grain became coarser. This loss could be predicted analytically for random maps with two land cover types, and it was observed in actual landscapes as grain was increased experimentally. However, the rate of loss was influenced by the spatial pattern. Land cover types that were clumped disappeared slowly or were retained with increasing grain, whereas cover types that were dispersed were lost rapidly. The diversity index decreased linearly with increasing grain size, but dominance and contagion did not show a linear relationship. The indices D and C increased with increasing extent, but H exhibited a variable response. The indices were sensitive to the number (m) of cover types observed in the data set and the fraction of the landscape occupied by each cover type (Pk); both m and Pkvaried with grain and extent. Qualitative and quantitative changes in measurements across spatial scales will differ depending on how scale is defined. Characterizing the relationships between ecological measurements and the grain or extent of the data may make it possible to predict or correct for the loss of information with changes in spatial scale.","spatial scale, grain, extent, resolution, landscape ecology, diversity, dominance, contagion, spatial pattern"
"Meniere's disease is the disorder of inner ear characterized by vertigo, tinnitus and sensorineural hearing loss. The vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) test could be useful in the analysis of saccular function, and diagnosis of Meniere's disease. In this study, we've analyzed the saccular function, using VEMP test in different groups of Meniere's disease. Patients were categorized as possible, probable or definite Meniere's disease groups according to the guideline of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. The exclusion criteria were neuromuscular system diseases, diseases of central nervous system, inner ear disorders, conductive hearing loss, a history of ototoxic drug consumption, being a drug abuser and a positive history of inner ear surgery or manipulations. The VEMP test is the recording of positive and negative waves from sternocleidomastoid muscle that is made by an auditory click to the ear. From the total of 100 patients, the waves of VEMP test was seen in 59 patients which 19 patients had abnormal amplitude, and latency and 40 patients were with normally recorded waves. There was a significant relationship between the severity of hearing loss and a VEMP test without any recorded waves. Most of the cases with 'no wave recorded' VEMP test, were patients with severe hearing loss. However, there wasn't any relation between the pattern of hearing loss and 'no wave recorded' VEMP test. VEMP test could be a valuable diagnostic clue especially in patients with definite Meniere's disease.","Meniere's disease, Saccule, VEMP, Vestibular system"
"The process of generating a clinical referral for a patient, and the resulting transfer of information from the primary care physician to the specialist and back again, are key components in the struggle to deliver less costly and more effective clinical care. We have created a computer-based, outpatient clinical referral application that facilitates: (1) identifying an appropriate specialist; (2) collecting the clinical, demographic, and financial data required to generate a referral; and (3) transferring the information between the specialist and the primary care physician (PCP). This article describes the development of the application itself and several of the knowledge bases that were created to facilitate this process. Preliminary results indicate that the new computer-based referral process is faster to use than conventional methods.","ambulatory care information systems, consultation, software design, referral, ambulatory care, knowledge base, information system"
"As the rapid development of wireless LAN and mobile network layer protocol Mobile-IP, a mobile user is allowed to access the service at the visited domain after he has been authenticated. The designing criteria of the inter-domain authentication protocols include: the scalability, the communication efficiency and the computational efficiency, and the robustness of security. In this article, we first show the weakness of some existing protocols against the session key compromise, and then propose a new and efficient interdomain authentication protocol. Based on public key, challenge-response and hash chaining, this new approach simultaneously achieves several practical merits: (1) good scalability, (2) low communication cost and low computational cost, and (3) resistance to the session key compromise attack.","large mobile network, kerberos, session key compromise, communication efficiency, existing protocol, mobile networking, computational efficiency, good scalability, public key, hybrid authentication protocol, authentication, session key compromise attack, efficient interdomain authentication protocol, low communication cost, inter-domain authentication protocol, hash chain, authentication protocol, mobile ip, mobile network"
"The error rate performance, obtained on a Rayleigh fading channel, is determined and illustrated graphically for concatenated codes in which the outer code is a dual- convolutional code and the inner code is either a Hadamard block code or a block orthogonal code. Comparison of the performance of these two types of concatenated codes is made on the basis of the same bandwidth utilization. It is also illustrated that the concatenated dual- code yields a significant improvement in performance relative to the performance achieved with the inner code alone.","Block codes, Concatenated codes, Convolutional codes, Fading channels, Hadamard transforms, Transform coding"
"Enterprise applications integrate information and applications in a distributed, networked environment to develop a global application of interconnected components and applications. This paper presents the design and implementation of the wrappers generated to adapt components to a middleware environment that employs active rules to build an enterprise application using an event-driven approach to integrating distributed black-box components. The components adapted in this implementation are based on the Enterprise JavaBeans component model. An application integrator declares the components to be integrated, and may define additional attributes, relationships, and events to be used in the integration process. The metadata for the components to be integrated is used to adapt and enhance the black-box components through the use of wrappers. The wrappers act as a proxy to the black-box component. The adaptation of the wrappers provides for the storage of additional properties for component instances and for the detection of events within the components to generate event notifications. The wrappers are automatically generated from the component metadata using the Extensible Stylesheet Language. The design and implementation of the wrappers establishes a framework that supports an active approach to component-based software integration.","enterprise javabeans component model, active approach, component adaptation, global application, event-based application integration, active rules, enterprise application, component metadata, black-box component, wrappers, component instance, application integrator, active rule, additional attribute, middleware, enterprise application integration, component model"
"In this paper, the seismic performance of steel frames equipped with superelastic SMA braces was investigated. To do so, buildings with various stories and different bracing configurations including diagonal, split X, chevron (V and inverted V) bracings were considered. Nonlinear time history analyses of steel braced frames equipped with SMA subjected to three ground motion records have been performed using OpenSees software. To evaluate the possibility of adopting this innovative bracing system and its efficiency, the dynamic responses of frames with SMA braces were compared to the ones with buckling restrained braces. After comparing the results, one can conclude that using an SMA element is an effective way to improve the dynamic response of structures subjected to earthquake excitations. Implementing the SMA braces can lead to a reduction in residual roof displacement and peak inter-story drift compare to the buckling restrained braced frames.","residual roof displacement, superelasticity, braced frames, shape memory alloys, shape memory alloy"
"Distillation, the most common separation process in chemical process industries, requires significant energy inputs. Dividing-Wall Column (DWC), which works on the basis of Fully Thermally Coupled Distillation System (FTCDS), is chosen for this study due to its lower energy consumption compared to the conventional column system. The main objective of this study is to investigate the potential of retrofitting conventional 2-column (C2C) systems in operation for separating ternary mixtures into three products, to DWCs. For this, six applications of industrial importance are selected and conventional 2-column systems are designed, which are assumed to be currently in operation in the plants. Then, retrofitting these systems to DWC is studied. Results show that retrofitting the existing 2-column systems to DWCs is very attractive both economically and for its reduced energy requirements.","dividing-wall column, hysys, fully thermally coupled distillation system, retrofitting, design"
"To determine what psychological and behavioral factors were most predictive of diabetic control.Seventy-nine youths with diabetes were assessed cross-sectionally, using youths' reports of self-esteem, anxiety, and attitudes about diabetes, and parents' reports of competence and psychopathology (from the Child Behavior Checklist) and diabetic adherence as independent variables. Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c was the dependent variable, reflecting diabetic control. After the effects of several background variables were partialed out, a principal-components analysis grouped the substantive variables into three larger components.Among the background variables, duration of illness and family size significantly predicted diabetic control. Among substantive components, Competence/Adherence (including Total Competence, dietary compliance, and frequency of blood glucose checks) was highly predictive of diabetic control, primarily due to the effect of Total Competence. Adjustment (including self-esteem, anxiety levels, and attitudes about diabetes) and Psychopathology were less predictive. A model was constructed showing the relationships between these predictive components and diabetic control.In this generally well-adjusted sample, that Total Competence, more than other measures, predicted diabetic control suggests it could be used by clinicians to anticipate diabetic youths at risk.","control, youths, diabetes, competence"
"Identification of biomarkers to recognize individuals with Barrett's esophagus (BE) predisposed to develop malignancy is currently a pressing issue. We utilized gene expression profiling to compare molecular signatures of normal esophagus and stomach, BE, and adenocarcinoma (AC) to identify such potential biomarkers. Over 22,000 genes were analyzed by oligonucleotide microarrays on 38 unique RNA Unsupervised and supervised clusterings were performed on a subset of 2849 genes that varied most significantly across the specimens. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for two of the significantly differentially expressed gene products was performed on tissue microarrays. Unsupervised clustering identified two discernable molecular BE profiles, one of which was similar to normal gastric tissue (""BE1""), and another that was shared by several of the AC specimens (""BE2""). The BE1 profile included expression of several genes that have been described as tumor-suppressor genes, most notably trefoil factor 1 (TFF-1). The BE2 profile included expression of genes previously found overexpressed in cancers, such as carboxylesterase-2 (CES-2). IHC demonstrated the loss of TFF-1 late in the progression of BE to AC. It also revealed CES-2 as being upregulated in AC documented to have arisen in the presence of BE. These potential biomarkers, as well as the relative expression of genes from BE1 versus those from BE2, may be validated in the future to aid in risk stratification and guide treatment protocols in patients with BE and associated AC.","barrett's esophagus, carboxylesterase 2, esophageal or gastric adenocarcinoma, tissue microarry, trefoil factor 1, gene expression profiling, oligonucleotides, immunohistochemistry, rna, signal transduction"
"This article empirically evaluates the main determinants of business performance, focusing on the emergence and sustainability of profits for an emerging economy such as Chile. Furthermore, the paper compares the results obtained with Chilean data to those for the U.S.A. This comparison is interesting because of the recent emergence of some literature that relates geographic location to performance. The results show that the industry effect is more important in Chile than in the U.S.A., that the persistence of rents in Chile is explained more evenly for reasons associated to business-, industry- and corporate-specific effects, and that the path to lower rents is more difficult to revert in Chile than in the U.S.A.","persistence, strategic management, sustainability, determinants of profitability, profitability, emerging economies"
"A two-dimensional Kalman filtering scheme based on the Roesser local state-space model is given. This algorithm does not provide the conditional mean with respect to previously scanned data; rather, it generates the best gain sequence with respect to local data and prediction.

"Analysis of a disaster event can identify strengths and weaknesses of the response implemented by the disaster management system; however, analysis does not typically occur until after the response phase is over. The result is that knowledge gained can only benefit future responses rather than the response under investigation. This article argues that there is an opportunity to conduct analysis while the response is operational due to the increasing availability of information within hours and days of a disaster event. Hence, this article introduces a methodology for analyzing publicly communicated disaster response information in near-real-time. A classification scheme for the disaster information needs of the public has been developed to facilitate analysis and has led to the establishment of best observed practice standards for content and timeliness. By comparing the information shared with the public within days of a disaster to these standards, information gaps are revealed that can be investigated further. The result is identification of potential deficiencies in communicating critical disaster response information to the public at a time when they can still be corrected.","Disaster response information, Forensic disaster analysis, Near-real-time analysis, Post disaster evaluation"
"Organizations are finding that their ability to respond to unpredicted changes in the market is becoming a key factor in survival. The ability to adjust e-business processes to customer preferences (flexibility) has become a necessity for online systems. Despite the interest in e-business flexibility the academic literature has not kept pace with industrial developments. This research study builds upon previous work through two investigations. First, the results of five case studies are used to develop a seven (alliance/joint decision management and intelligence, enterprise-wide change management, organizational learning, process oriented agility, network centric information management, leadership of transformation and knowledge exchange meetings) factor model that depicts the influences of flexibility on organizational effectiveness in e-business environments. Second, this paper illustrates how the model can be used as a benchmarking tool and has the potential to become a key learning mechanism. The authors discuss the conclusions and managerial implications of the findings.","flexibility, e-business, benchmarking, performance, effectiveness, organizational effectiveness, e business, information management, organizational learning, business process, factor model, change management"
"The difficulty in learning and teaching the algorithms and programming subjects is a major concern for managers and teachers of Computer Science (CS) undergraduate courses. These are foundational subjects for CS professionals, yet continue to present a high degree of difficulty in learning for students. This paper presents two experiences we conducted with Computer Science beginner students related to the teaching of computer programming. Results obtained were positive and encouraging in a way that continues to be used with new students in CS courses. We are convinced that other actions like this one are vital for interdisciplinary work, preventing student evasion resulting from the learning environment, casting them as process actors.

"The exterior, or facade, consists of the initial statement which the student makes to the counselor by way of explaining his poor showing in college. The facade plays a positive role because, as a function of the interior, it becomes a reference point to which other facts, feelings, and relationships can be oriented. The cause for low scholarship may be determined without difficulty directly behind the facade in some cases; in others, the causes may be complex and go back to the student's family situation.

"Infants with enterostomies frequently have signs of short bowel syndrome. Our goal was to assess the effect of dietary lipids on ostomy output and weight gain in infants with enterostomies.We reviewed the medical records of 10 neonates with necrotizing enterocolitis or isolated intestinal perforations requiring temporary enterostomies. Infants had high stoma outputs and poor weight gain. All infants received a commercially available soluble dietary fat supplement added to their enteral feedings. Ostomy output as a percentage of enteral intake and daily weight gain were compared over 5-day intervals before and after adding the dietary fat.We observed a decrease in ostomy output after the addition of dietary lipids to enteral feedings, from an average of 29.3% to 19.8% of dietary intake, a relative decrease of 32% (P < .05). Daily weight gain increased from an average of 7.7 g/d to 26.8 g/d (P < .01) after treatment initiation. Infants with the greatest ostomy output (>20% of dietary intake) benefited the most by adding the dietary fat.Dietary lipids appear to decrease ostomy output and improve weight gain in infants with enterostomies and short bowel syndrome. The use of dietary lipids may be helpful in infants with enterostomies to limit the morbidity of this condition.","growth, dietary fat, short bowel syndrome, ileostomy, necrotizing enterocolitis"
"Case-based reasoning (CBR)-driven medical diagnostic systems demand a critical mass of up-to-date diagnostic-quality cases that depict the problem-solving methodology of medical experts. In practical terms, procurement of CBR-compliant cases is quite challenging, as this requires medical experts to map their experiential knowledge to an unfamiliar computational formalism. In this paper, we propose a novel medical knowledge acquisition approach that leverages routinely generated electronic medical records (EMRs) as an alternate source for CBR-compliant cases. We present a methodology to autonomously transform XML-based EMR to specialized CBR-compliant cases for CBR-driven medical diagnostic systems. Our multi-stage methodology features: (a) collection of heterogeneous EMR from Internet-accessible EMR repositories via intelligent agents, (b) automated transformation of both the structure and content of generic EMR to specialized CBR-compliant cases, and (c) inductive estimation of the weight of each case-defining attribute. The computational implementation of our methodology is presented as case acquisition and transcription info-structure (CATI).","knowledge acquisition, electronic medical records, xml, case-based reasoning, case based reasoning"
"G protein-coupled receptors play particularly important roles in many organisms. The novel Drosophila gene anchor is an orthologue of vertebrate GPR155. However, the roles of anchor in molecular functions and biological processes, especially in wing development, remain unknown. Knockdown of anchor resulted in an increased wing size and additional and thickened veins. These abnormal wing phenotypes were similar to those observed in BMP signalling gain-of-function experiments. We observed that the BMP signalling indicator p-Mad was significantly increased in wing discs in which anchor RNAi was induced in larvae and accumulated abnormally in intervein regions in pupae. Furthermore, the expression of target genes of the BMP signalling pathway was examined using a lacZ reporter, and the results indicated that omb and sal were substantially increased in anchor-knockdown wing discs. An investigation of genetic interactions between Anchor and the BMP signalling pathway revealed that the thickened and ectopic vein tissues were rescued by knocking down BMP levels. These results suggested that Anchor functions to negatively regulate BMP signalling during wing development and vein formation.","BMP pathway, CG7510, GPR155, Wing veins, p-Mad"

"To investigate the effect of melatonin treatment on sleep, behavior, cognition, and quality of life in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and chronic sleep onset insomnia.A total of 105 medication-free children, ages 6 to 12 years, with rigorously diagnosed ADHD and chronic sleep onset insomnia participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial using 3 or 6 mg melatonin (depending on body weight), or placebo for 4 weeks. Primary outcome parameters were actigraphy-derived sleep onset, total time asleep, and salivary dim light melatonin onset.Sleep onset advanced by 26.9 +/- 47.8 minutes with melatonin and delayed by 10.5 +/- 37.4 minutes with placebo (p < .0001). There was an advance in dim light melatonin onset of 44.4 +/- 67.9 minutes in melatonin and a delay of 12.8 +/- 60.0 minutes in placebo (p < .0001). Total time asleep increased with melatonin (19.8 +/- 61.9 minutes) as compared to placebo (-13.6 +/- 50.6 minutes; p = .01). There was no significant effect on behavior, cognition, and quality of life, and significant adverse events did not occur.Melatonin advanced circadian rhythms of sleep-wake and endogenous melatonin and enhanced total time asleep in children with ADHD and chronic sleep onset insomnia; however, no effect was found on problem behavior, cognitive performance, or quality of life.","melatonin, 2007, 462:233y241. key words: melatonin, psychiatry, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder., insomnia, cognitive processes, quality of life, sleep, body weight, drug therapy"
"A finite element method of distortional buckling analysis is described briefly, in which the frequently applied 12 degree of freedom beam-type element is extended to a 16 degree of freedom formulation. This extension allows the buckling of beams with a variety of elastic restraints to be modelled accurately. The finite element method is then applied to a cantilever beam with a tip load. A variety of restraints are considered, as would be experienced in purlin/sheeting systems that restrain the beam. Conclusions are drawn regarding the buckling response of elastically restrained cantilevers.","distortion, cantilevers, elastic restraints, bracing, buckling, elasticity, cantilever beam, finite element method, degree of freedom"
"Despite the paramount influence of top managers within a firm, extant literature has under-researched the specific role of top management in market knowledge development. Drawing on social networks theory, the authors conceptualize a linkage between top management networks (TMNs) and market knowledge management. Based on a sample of Chinese firms, the results show that networking embeddedness of TMNs promotes new knowledge creation, but too much networking embeddedness leads to diminished returns. In addition, networking disparity of TMNs has a negative influence on existing knowledge sharing, and technological turbulence seems to weaken this negative impact. The findings have some important implications for marketing research and for managers on how to obtain superior learning in Chinese Economy.","learning, market knowledge, embeddedness, top management networks, china, market research, social network theory, knowledge management"
"The nonlinear response of Tension Braced Moment Resisting Frames (TBMRF) under lateral loading with regards to their sequential failure mechanisms and ductility is studied. Both distributed and lumped plasticity finite element approaches are considered and parametric studies are carried out to evaluate the sequence of element failures in various single and multi-storey TBMRFs. Three possible failure mechanisms representing different specific characteristics of TBMRF systems are presented and their differences are outlined. Also, several multi-storey dual-system TBMRFs are analyzed and the results are utilized to set up an analytical model which can appropriately differentiate and evaluate the load carrying contribution of brace and frame elements. Finally, an empirical formula and design curves to calculate frame-brace contribution ratios in different performance levels are proposed.","dual system, ductility, collapse mechanism, tension bracing, finite element"
"New attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) subtypes identified through latent class analysis have been recently proposed. Here, we assess the accuracy of simple rules based on symptom counts for the assignment of youths to clinically relevant population-derived ADHD subtypes: severe inattentive (SI) and severe combined (SC).Data from 9,675 twins and siblings from Missouri and Australia aged 7 to 19 years were analyzed using continuous and categorical models of ADHD symptoms using principal components analysis and subtyping by DSM-IV and by latent class criteria. Cut points were derived for classifying SI and SC subtypes by positive predictive value, negative predictive value, percent positive agreement, and Matthew coefficient of agreement.Principal components analysis suggested two underlying factors: total number of symptoms and symptom type, with SI and SC latent class subtypes clearly mapping to distinct areas on a plot of these factors. Having six or more total symptoms and fewer than three hyperactive-impulsive symptoms accurately predicts the latent class SI subtype. The latent class SC subtype was best identified by 11 or more total symptoms and 4 or more hyperactive-impulsive. The DSM-IV ADHD subtype criteria accurately identified the SC subtype but only poorly for the SI subtype.Symptom counts criteria allow the simple and accurate identification of subjects with severe ADHD subtypes defined by latent class analysis. Such simple symptom counts corresponding to screening cut points selected latent class-derived SI subtype subjects with greater precision than DSM-IV criteria.","subtype, adhd, clinical, latent class analysis, rule based, evaluation methods"
"Two male half siblings developed rapid progression of neurologic symptoms at 11/2 and 21/2 years of age. Neither boy had a metabolic acidosis. Characteristic features of subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy, the neuropathologic basis of Leigh's syndrome, were demonstrated at autopsy. X-linkage of the disorder was considered because the boys had different fathers. An X-linked form of Leigh's syndrome was supported by a review of the literature, which showed an unexplained male/female ratio in Leigh's syndrome of 1.83/l, and a significant excess of male-male siblings. An X-linked form of Leigh's syndrome would explain the excess of males, and may account for some of the clinical and biochemical heterogeneity.","Internal Medicine, Metabolic Disease, Characteristic Feature, Neurologic Symptom, Metabolic Acidosis"
"Cannabis is known to be associated with neuropsychiatric problems, but less is known about complications affecting other specified body systems. We report and analyze 35 recent remarkable cardiovascular complications following cannabis use.In France, serious cases of abuse and dependence in response to the use of psychoactive substances must be reported to the national system of the French Addictovigilance Network. We identified all spontaneous reports of cardiovascular complications related to cannabis use collected by the French Addictovigilance Network from 2006 to 2010. We described the clinical characteristics of these cases and their evolution: 1.8% of all cannabis-related reports (35/1979) were cardiovascular complications, with patients being mostly men (85.7%) and of an average age of 34.3 years. There were 22 cardiac complications (20 acute coronary syndromes), 10 peripheral complications (lower limb or juvenile arteriopathies and Buerger-like diseases), and 3 cerebral complications (acute cerebral angiopathy, transient cortical blindness, and spasm of cerebral artery). In 9 cases, the event led to patient death.Increased reporting of cardiovascular complications related to cannabis and their extreme seriousness (with a death rate of 25.6%) indicate cannabis as a possible risk factor for cardiovascular disease in young adults, in line with previous findings. Given that cannabis is perceived to be harmless by the general public and that legalization of its use is debated, data concerning its danger must be widely disseminated. Practitioners should be aware that cannabis may be a potential triggering factor for cardiovascular complications in young people.","acute coronary syndrome, drug abuse, pharmacodependence, stroke, vascular complications, young, young adult, risk assessment, cerebrovascular disease, cause of death, pharmacovigilance, risk factors"
"In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a programmable and extensible router architecture. The proposed architecture not only provides the conventional packet forward/routing functions, but also the flexibility to integrate additional services (or extension) into a router. These extensions are dynamically loadable modules so one can easily deploy new services, such as reliability and security enhancement, onto the router in a dynamic and incremental fashion. To avoid new extensions that may monopolize system resource and degrade the performance of normal packet forwarding/routing function, we propose a novel CPU resource reservation scheme which facilitates the efficient use of resources and increases the stability of extension execution. To illustrate the ''extensibility'' and ''effectiveness'' of the proposed architecture, we present the results of a new service, namely, how to perform ''Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack traceback''. In particular, we illustrate the deployment of the probabilistic marking in performing IP traceback. Note that this approach requires the collaboration of routers so that effective traceback can be performed. Currently, the programmable router platform is released as an open source and we believe the system provides an ideal platform for researchers to experiment and to validate new services and protocols.","programmable router, open-source extensible router architecture, extensible router architecture, new extension, effective traceback, network system software, deploy new service, ip traceback, new network service, programmable router platform, new service, attack traceback, conventional packet, proposed architecture, denial of service, packet forwarding, ddos attack"
"Numerous congenital and acquired liver diseases could benefit from a successful hepatic cell therapy strategy. Hepatotypic cells derived from bone marrow have been recognized during liver injury, repair, and regeneration. To study this phenomenon, we compared the effect of several modes of experimental hepatic injury on hepatotypic protein expression in a mouse model after bone marrow transplantation.Male mice transgenic for the liver-specific protein human alpha-1 antitrypsin (hAAT) were used as bone marrow donors. Syngeneic wild-type recipient mice were subjected to 1 of 3 hepatic injuries: (1) sublethal irradiation, (2) injection of a hepatotoxic adenoviral construct, and (3) administration of a hepatotoxic diet. Bone marrow-derived hepatotypic (BMdH) transgene expression was determined by serial serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for hAAT.In both acute injury models, hAAT expression was detected as early as 1 week, whereas the control group never elicited hAAT expression. The adenovirus-treated group demonstrated transient hAAT level expression lasting up to 2 weeks postinjury, whereas the irradiated group maintained persistent hAAT expression through 4 months. In the chronic injury (hepatotoxin) model, hAAT expression persisted and was noted to increase over time to 200 to 300 ng/mL.Irradiation favors long-term establishment of BMdH transgene expression, and chronic injury further promotes this phenomenon.","bone marrow-derived hepatocyte, liver injury transdifferentiation, liver repair and regeneration, bone marrow transplantation, kinetics, protein expression, cell therapy"
"The experiment was to develop a kind of fermented beef jerky compounded with vegetables and fruits which had the advantages of balanced and rich nutrition, easy digest, unique flavor and long shelf-life.

"The goals of evaluating correctness properties of software architectures include: (1) to provide an early opportunity to correct defects in requirements embodied in the software architecture, and (2) to ensure that the software architecture is an accurate blueprint for system implementers. While evaluation of both static and dynamic correctness properties is essential to achieve these goals, this paper focuses on dynamic correctness properties, including safety, liveness, and completeness. A new software architecture evaluation tool called Arcade, developed to support the Systems Engineering Process Activities (SEPA), provides dynamic correctness property evaluations using the complementary techniques of simulation and model checking. SEPA suggests a comprehensive approach to capture and represent yet separate different types of requirements as a multi-level software architecture. One SEPA architecture level, the Domain Reference Architecture (DRA), is employed early in the analysis process to represent requirements inherent to the domain, thereby specifying a reusable blueprint in terms of what processes, data, and timing are required, rather than how a system should be implemented. Arcade provides the architect with early feedback from correctness evaluations by leveraging the formal DRA meta-model to enable model checking and generating a Execution Space visualization to aid completeness validation.","multi-level software architecture, correctness property, domain reference architecture, new software architecture evaluation, early feedback, model checking, dynamic properties, dynamic correctness property, domain-specific software architectures, software architecture, correctness evaluation, dynamic correctness property evaluation, dynamic correctness, sepa architecture level, reference architecture, meta model"
"The German Radar Symposium (GRS 2002), organized jointly by the German Institute of Navigation (DGON) and by the Information Technology Society (VDE-ITG), attracted wide interest in the international radar community. It was held from September 3-5, 2002, in Bonn, the former capital city of Germany. The GRS 2002 programme covered a large scale of important radar topics. All classical topics like air traffic control, CFAR, antenna technology, signal processing and simulation papers have been presented and new results were demonstrated. These topics were combined with new applications like meteorology, subsurface, and automotive to underline the increase of interest in radar technology. Phased array antennas are the key elements of high performance multi-function radar systems which are studied all over the world. SAR and ISAR are, nowadays, essential radar techniques for civil and military observation and monitoring.","air traffic control, antenna phased arrays, ground penetrating radar, meteorological radar, radar antennas, radar signal processing, road vehicle radar, synthetic aperture radar, CFAR, GRS 2002, German Radar Symposium, ISAR, SAR, air traffic control, antenna technology, automotive radar, meteorology, multi-function radar systems, phased array antennas, radar technology, signal processing, subsurface radar"
"Improved identification of children with an increased likelihood of death can support appropriate provision of integrated palliative care. This systematic review aims to consider immobility and the associated likelihood of death in children with disabilities, living in high-income countries. Two reviewers independently searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, OpenGrey and Science Citation Index (1990-2016) for studies that reported hazard ratios (HRs) and relative risk for the likelihood of death related to impaired mobility. Nine papers were included. Three studies reported functioning using the Gross Motor Function Classification Scale (GMFCS) and the remaining studies reported measures of functioning unique to the study. The strongest single prognostic factor for the likelihood of death was 'lack of sitting ability at 24 months', HR 44.4 (confidence interval (CI) 6.1-320.8) followed by GMFCS V HR 16.3 (CI 5.6-47.2) and 11.4 (CI 3.76-35.57) and 'not able to cruise by 24 months', HR 14.4 (CI 3.5-59.2). Immobility is associated with an increased risk of dying over study periods, but different referent groups make clinical interpretation challenging. Overall, the quality of evidence is moderate. The findings suggest that immobility can support identification of children who may benefit from integrated palliative care.","Child health, GMFCS, disability, functioning, immobility, palliative care, systematic review"

"The importance of aeroallergens as triggers for asthma is well recognized, but the relationship between asthma severity and atopic profiles in childhood has not been elucidated. This study assessed the relationship of allergen sensitization to asthma severity in a study of 114 asthmatic children followed for 8 weeks in three Southern California areas. Increased controller medication and beta-agonist use were positively associated with number of positive skin tests and allergy to mold and pollens. Mold was associated with increased asthma symptoms. Degree of atopy and reactivity to mold and pollens plays a significant role in asthma severity in asthmatic children.","severity of illness index, risk factors, epidemiology, panel study"
"Connexin channels clustered at gap junctions are obligatory attributes of all macroscopic endocrine and exocrine glands investigated so far and also connect most types of cells which produce secretory products in other tissues. Increasing evidence indicates that connexins, and the cell-to-cell communications that these proteins permit, contribute to control the growth of secretory cells, their expression of specific genes and their differentiated function, including their characteristic ability to biosynthetize and release secretory products in a regulated manner. Since the previous reviews which have been published on this topic, several lines of evidence have been added in support of multiple regulatory roles of gland connexins. Here, we review this novel evidence, point to the many questions which are still open and discuss some interesting perspectives of the field.","endocrine glands, pancreas, exocrine glands, gap junctions"
"Euler diagrams are an accessible and effective visualisation of data involving simple set-theoretic relationships. Sets are represented by closed curves in the plane and often have wellformedness conditions placed on them in order to enhance comprehensibility. The theoretical underpinning for tool support has usually focussed on the problem of generating an Euler diagram from an abstract model. However, the problem of efficient computation of the abstract model from the concrete diagram has not been addressed before, despite this computation being a necessity for computer interpretations of user drawn diagrams. This may be used, together with automated manipulations of the abstract model, for purposes such as semantic information presentation or diagrammatic theorem proving. Furthermore, in interactive settings, the user may update diagrams ''on-line'' by adding and removing curves, for example, in which case a system requirement is the update of the abstract model (without the necessity of recomputation of the entire abstract model). We define the notion of marked Euler diagrams, together with a method for associating marked points on the diagram with regions in the plane. Utilising these, we provide on-line algorithms which quickly compute the abstract model of a weakly reducible wellformed Euler diagram (constructible as a sequence of additions or removals of curves, keeping a wellformed diagram at each step), and quickly updates both the set of curves in the plane as well as the abstract model according to the on-line operations. Efficiency is demonstrated by comparison with a common, naive algorithm. Furthermore, the methodology enables a straightforward implementation which has subsequently been realised as an application for the user classification domain.","euler diagram region computation, marked euler diagram, abstract model, on-line algorithm, efficient on-line algorithm, entire abstract model, on-line operation, efficient computation, euler diagrams, diagram generation, concrete diagram, user classification domain, region computation, wellformed diagram, euler diagram, theorem proving"
"Prior knowledge has been considered as valuable supplementary information in many image processing techniques. In this paper, we take the input image itself as the guidance prior and develop a novel fuzzy clustering algorithm to segment it by adding a new term to the objective function of Fuzzy C-Means. The new term comes from Guided Filter for its capability in noise suppression and edge-preserving smoothing. As a result, the memberships derived from the new objective function incorporate the guidance information from the image to be segmented. In this way, the segmentation result retains more subtle details on the boundaries of segments. According to experimental results, the proposed method shows good performance in image segmentation tasks especially for images with high noise rates.","Fuzzy clustering method, Guided Filter, Prior knowledge, Edge information"
"The relative bioavailability of an orally administered aqueous suspension of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) intended for intramuscular injection (Depo-Provera) was determined in relation to orally administered tablets. Serum levels of MPA were determined by radioimmunoassay following the administration of 400-mg doses to 19 adult male volunteers in a crossover design after an overnight fast. The two treatments were judged bioequivalent based upon a comparison of the resultant MPA serum levels and the derived bioavailability parameters. Hence, the intramuscular suspension administered orally offers an alternative means of achieving optimal serum levels of MPA in patients requiring high dose therapy.","analysis, population, clinical research, medicine, treatment, research methodology, health"
"This is the first of the three companion papers dealing with the restrained steel column behaviours in fire. This paper reports the results of two new fire tests on axially and rotationally restrained steel columns that have different axial restraint stiffness. Axial and rotational restraints were applied by a restraint beam. The external applied axial load was kept constant during the fire test. The increase and decrease in axial force in the restrained steel column was borne by the restraint beam. Test results included the temperature, the axial displacement and the lateral deflection of the test column. It was found that the axial restraint reduced the buckling temperature of a restrained column. The effects of axial restraint to the failure temperature depended on the load ratio and the axial restraint stiffness ratio. A Finite Element Method (FEM) model was built to simulate the fire test. The damping factor fitting for simulating behaviours of restrained steel column in fire was selected through parametric analysis. The validated FEM model was used to perform parametric studies on the behaviour of restrained steel column in Part 2, results of which were used to develop a practical design method for restrained steel column in fire in Part 3.","restrained steel column, numeric analysis, fire test, failure temperature, buckling temperature, design method, parametric analysis, numerical analysis, finite element method"
"Purpose : The purpose of this study was to prospectively study certain surgical approaches to renal artery stenosis and the long-term outcomes. Methods : One hundred thirty-six children were evaluated for severe hypertension, 53 had renovascular lesions. The approach to diagnosis, the role of balloon angioplasty, comparison of reimplantation with bypass grafting, the role of vein grafts and the incidence of graft aneurysm formation, the possible protective effect of vein graft mesh wraps, and approaches to treatment of associated aortic and visceral artery narrowing were all studied prospectively and the long-term results evaluated. Results : Fibromuscular hyperplasia (FMH) was the main etiology (45 of 53 patients), with 17 of these having midaortic involvement as well. Sex distribution was equal; average age was 9 years. Malignant hypertension was the rule, and three had renal failure. Twenty-three of the 45 had bilateral vessel involvement. Fifty of the 53 patients underwent operation. Aortography was the most definitive approach to diagnosis and planning therapy. Balloon angioplasty was used in eight patients, but this only worked long term in branch vessel locations or at graft anastomoses. A variety of surgical approaches were used depending on the pathology encountered. Thirty-eight patients underwent revascularization, seven underwent primary nephrectomy, five underwent primary partial nephrectomy, and 12 had aortoaortic bypass performed. Seventy percent were cured, 26% improved; and 4% did not respond to treatment with up to 16 years of follow-up. There was no mortality.","childhood hypertension, renal artery stenosis, midaortic syndrome, arteriopathy, renovascular hypertension, prospective study"
"Perineural cysts are common lesions of the sacral spine. They have rarely been reported in a presacral location, leading to their misdiagnosis as a gynecological lesion. The authors report the second such case, in a patient undergoing fenestration of what was presumed to be a benign pelvic cyst, and the resultant high-flow CSF leak that occurred. They describe the clinical presentation and manifestations of intracranial hypotension, as well as the pertinent investigations. They also review the literature for the best management options for this condition. Although they are uncommon, large perineural cysts should be included in the differential diagnosis when examining patients with a pelvic lesion. Appropriate imaging investigations should be performed to rule out a perineural cyst. The CSF leak that occurs from iatrogenic cyst fenestration may not respond to traditional first-line treatments for intracranial hypotension and may require early surgical intervention. The authors would recommend neurosurgical involvement prior to definitive treatment.","complication, iatrogenic injury, intracranial hypotension, review"

"Parents' concerns typically determine the focus of a primary care visit. This study examined which information is lost if child reports are excluded from screening for anxiety. It also explores the use in primary care of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-17).Two hundred thirty-six children (8-12 years 11 months) and their parents completed SCARED and PSC-17 before a primary care visit occurring during discrete periods between June 1999 and March 2001.Child reports yielded higher SCARED scores than parent reports (mean=18.12, SD=12.14 versus 14.43, SD=10.34, p <.001). Somatic/panic and separation anxiety accounted for 73.8% of the excess score from children's reports. The level of parent-reported symptoms did not vary with demographics. Female gender and younger age predicted greater excess reporting by children. Parent and child scores were moderately to highly correlated (R=0.55 total score; 0.40-0.58 subfactors).There are discrete anxiety domains in which children's reports are likely to yield more information than that of parents. This phenomenon is almost entirely attributable to variations in the level of symptoms reported by children. Studies are needed to design brief screening procedures that integrate parent and child reports and carry age- and gender-adjusted thresholds.","screen for child anxiety related emotional disorders, anxiety, anxiety disorders, primary health care, pediatric symptom checklist, pediatrics, psychiatry"

In the team's view, the balance between the time spent on the review, and the outputs and skills acquired was favourable.

"Humor is an important coping mechanism and can improve mood. However, it is unclear whether depressed patients are able to enjoy funny material, e.g. jokes, and make use of their sense of humor for coping with adverse situations. This study aims at investigating the influence of depression on various aspects of humor abilities such as sense of humor, appraisal of funny material and exhilaration.Nineteen patients with major depression and 18 healthy controls were examined with standardized self-assessment questionnaires to study potential group differences in humor type preferences, state and trait cheerfulness, seriousness and bad mood as well as humor coping.Patients and controls did not differ in their humor type preferences and the degree to which humorous stimuli were rated as being funny. The readiness to react to funny stimuli with exhilaration was significantly less pronounced in the patient group. The patients' tendency to use humor as a coping strategy was significantly lower than in the control group.The susceptibility to humorous material seems to be unaffected by the disorder. Introducing means to promote humor behavior might therefore be beneficial to depressed patients. Study limitations were that only self-rating instruments were used and that the medication was inhomogeneous.","control group, humor, coping, coping strategies, depression"
"The MMPI was administered twice to a group of 48 military psychiatric patients. The first administration was under the usual instructional set while the second was under an ""ideal self"" set. The following 4 hypotheses were confirmed: the introduction of an ""ideal self"" set produces changes in the MMPI patterns of patients referred for psychiatric consultation; changes are in the direction of fewer scores in the ""critical"" or ""unhealthy"" range; the more deviant the original MMPI record, the more marked the changes; the interindividual variability is significantly less on the ""ideal self"" pattern than on the ""real self"" pattern.

"The structural behavior of stub columns using fire-resistant steel has been investigated experimentally under uniform fire load. The newly-developed fire-resistant steel is proven to have higher strength at elevated temperature than that of conventional steel. Also, the requirement of fire-protection in the fire-resisting steel can be released or relaxed as compared with conventional steel structures. However, the design criteria for the application of the fire-resisting steel in steel columns are still limited. To examine the structural behavior of this type of steel columns under fire load, a total of 24 stub column specimens, including both box columns and H columns, reached their limit states due to axial load under fire condition. The main purpose of these studies is to evaluate the variations of the ultimate strength of steel columns due to different width-to-thickness ratios under specified elevated temperature; in addition, to investigate the reduction effects on column strength resulting in the increasing temperature; and finally, to establish the design guidelines of steel columns using fire-resisting steel. From the experimental results, it is found that the ultimate loads of the stub columns decrease while the width-to-thickness ratios or the temperature increases. However, with the increase of temperature, the effect of the width-to-thickness ratio on ultimate strength decreases. It is also found that the effect of the width-to-thickness ratio on the ultimate strength of box column at elevated temperature is more significant than that of H column. Based on these studies, design guidelines are proposed for the requirement of the width-to-thickness ratios of both box column and H column fabricated from fire-resisting steel.","fire-resistant steel, unstiffened elements, fire load, stiffened elements, elevated temperature, local buckling, study design, fire resistance"
"The authors investigate consumers' motivations for placing items in an online shopping cart with or without buying, termed virtual cart use. While retailers offer virtual carts as a functional holding space for intended online purchases, this study, based on a national online sample, reveals other powerful utilitarian and hedonic motivations that explain the frequency of consumers' online cart use. Beyond current purchase intentions, the investigated reasons for why consumers place items in their carts include: securing online price promotions, obtaining more information on certain products, organizing shopping items, and entertainment. Based on empirical findings, the authors offer managerial suggestions for enhancing online shopping-to-buying conversion rates.","online shopping motivations, online buying, online consumer behavior, e-commerce, consumer behavior, e commerce"

"A hybrid passive control device (HPCD) consisting of a high-damping rubber (HDR) damper in series with a buckling-restrained brace (BRB) provides an innovative two-phase system for improving structural response to earthquakes. The initial phase provides damping for all magnitudes of vibration through an HDR damper. The second phase is initiated by a locking mechanism in the damper. Once engaged, the mechanism transfers sufficient force to yield the BRB. Component testing of an HPCD prototype was used to demonstrate performance and validate device design. The experimental results reported in this paper show the expected phased behavior and energy dissipation. The physical testing provides a proof-of-concept for the HPCD and supplies the motivation for further development.","structural control, experimental testing, high-damping rubber, passive energy dissipation, seismic protection, proof of concept, energy dissipation"
"Using ab initio spin density functional theory, we investigate the energetics and kinetics of Ti clustering on both neutral and charged C(60) surfaces. We compare the formation energy of sparsely dispersed zero-dimensional (0D), compact single-layered two-dimensional (2D), and clustered three-dimensional (3D) Ti(N) configurations as a function of cluster size (N < or = 12) and further study the transformation kinetics between them. We find that 0D configuration is always less stable than that of 2D and 3D configurations and 0D to 2D transformation involves in a single Ti diffusion process with kinetic barrier of < or = 0.7 eV. On the other hand, there exists a critical cluster size (N(C)) of N(C) = 5, below which 2D layers are preferred to 3D clusters. Hole- or B-doping greatly enhance the Ti-fullerene interaction and lead to stronger dispersion of Ti atoms. Even so, for moderate charge doping (less than seven holes) the critical size of Ti atoms on neutral C(60) surprisingly remains unchanged or only slightly increases to N(C) = 6 by B-doping. However, we find that the formation of 3D clusters may be hindered by a high kinetic barrier related to the process of single Ti atoms climbing up a single Ti layer. This barrier is approximately 1 eV or even 1.47 eV for B-doped C(60) surfaces which is high enough to stabilize larger 2D structures (N > or = N(C)) at low temperatures. These findings may prove to be instrumental in stabilizing transition metal coated nanostructures and especially homogeneously Ti-coated fullerenes, which are believed to be a very promising material for hydrogen storage.","ionic conductivity, transition metal, hydrogen storage, kinetics, energy conversion, diffusion process, three dimensional"
"The sorption properties of strontium in the soil of a nuclear waste repository were investigated by column method. The effects of pH values, flux, granularities of the soil, initial mass concentration of strontium solution on the sorption properties were also studied. The equilibrium adsorptive quantities are 6.35, 8.61, 9.46, 9.73 mg/g when pH values are 4, 6, 8, 10 respectively (grain sizes: 0.178-0.840 mm, flux: 60 mL/h, initial mass concentration of Sr2+:10 mg/L). The equilibrium adsorptive quantities are 9.73, 15.48, 18.26, 22.30 mg/g when the mass concentrations of Sr2+ are 10, 15, 17, 20 mg/L respectively (grain sizes: 0.178-0.840 mm, flux: 60 mL/h, pH value: 10). The equilibrium adsorptive quantities are 22.22, 28.06, 39.52 mg/g when grain sizes are 0.178-0.840 mm, 0.124-0.178 mm and less than 0.124 mm(pH value: 10, flux: 60 mL/h, mass concentration of Sr2+: 10 mg/L). And the equilibrium adsorptive quantities are 9.37, 9.52, 10.72 mg/g when the fluxs are 60, 120, 200 mL/h respectively (grain sizes: 0.178-0.840 mm, pH value: 10, mass concentration of Sr2+:10 mg/L). The sorption quantities increase with the increasing of pH values, flux and the initial mass concentration of strontium solution and decrease with the increasing of the grain size of the soil. The mechanism of strontium sorption in soil was researched as well. Experimental data are analyzed with first-order kinetic equation, Elovich equation, parabola equation and double constant equation. In the four equations, Elovich equation fits the experimental data best. The experiment results show that the maximum strontium sorption rate by the soil of the primary selected nuclear waste repository is 48.8%, and the sorption properties are not well.","Column method, Equations of absorbent kinetics, Sorption, Strontium"
"For the practical use of high-capacity silicon anodes in high-energy lithium-based batteries, key issues arising from the large volume change of silicon during cycling must be addressed by the facile structural design of silicon. Herein, we discuss the zeolite-templated magnesiothermic reduction synthesis of mesoporous silicon (mpSi) (mpSi-Y, -B, and -Z derived from commercial zeolite Y, Beta, and ZSM-5, respectively) microparticles having large pore volume (0.4-0.5 cm3/g), wide open pore size (19-31 nm), and small primary silicon particles (20-35 nm). With these appealing mpSi particle structural features, a series of mpSi/C composites exhibit outstanding performance including excellent cycling stabilities for 500 cycles, high specific and volumetric capacities (1100-1700 mAh g-1 and 640-1000 mAh cm-3 at 100 mA g-1), high Coulombic efficiencies (approximately 100%), and remarkable rate capabilities, whereas conventional silicon nanoparticles (SiNP)/C demonstrates limited cycle life. These enhanced electrochemical responses of mpSi/C composites are further manifested by low impedance build-up, high Li ion diffusion rate, and small electrode thickness changes after cycling compared with those of SiNP/C composite. In addition to the outstanding electrochemical properties, the low-cost materials and high-yield processing make the mpSi/C composites attractive candidates for high-performance and high-energy Li-ion battery anodes.","mesoporous silicon, magnesiothermic reduction, zeolites, energy storage, Li-ion battery"
"To test the prediction that the interaction of physical abuse and internalizing problems will heighten levels of aggressive behavior in a group of disruptive children.Fifty-two clinic-referred disruptive children (aged 7 through 15 years) were assessed in terms of history of physical abuse, internalizing behavior problems (rated by parents), and aggressive behavior (rated by parents, teachers, and clinic staff).Physically abused children with co-occurring high levels of internalizing problems (based on a median split) exhibited significantly higher levels of aggression as rated by parents (p < .000) and teachers (p < .020) and a trend toward heightened aggression as rated by staff (p < .08). The patterns were similar across the three independent informants and remained regardless of age, gender, or race.Physical abuse was related to heightened levels of aggression only in those children who also had emotional difficulties. Results lend some support to a transactional model of the development of aggression, suggesting that problems arise out of interactions between child factors (such as internalizing problems) and adverse family experiences (such as physical abuse).","aggression, internalizing behavior, physical abuse, emotion"
"Urban traffic control system (UTCS) is one of the most important tasks of intelligent transportation system (ITS), and it's a kind of large-scale complex system. Therefore, it should adopted integrated and intelligent methods. Moreover, it should make comprehensive utilization of multiple control patterns and of multiple control modes, integrate classical control methods and AI technologies seamlessly, combine intelligence of both human being and machine, and implement good cooperation among various systems of traffic management and control. Under the direction of the architecture of integrated intelligent urban traffic (signal) control system (IIUTCS), functions of dynamic self-organization decision can be implemented in the decision layer. In this paper, the overall solution of dynamic self-organization decision is worked out, a structural model of UTCS based on fuzzy adjacent matrix is put forward, and the method of signal cycles balance and the procedure of dynamic self-organization decision of UTCS are discussed in detail. Finally, conclusion is drawn based on the elementary results of a prototype testing over a typical signalized traffic network.","Fuzzy adjacent matrix, Integrated intelligent control system, Intelligent transportation system, Self-organization decision, Urban traffic control system (UTCS)"
"Snakes have intrathoracic stomachs and rachischisis-like spinal vertebrae. These anomalies are rare in babies and have not been previously described in combination in the English medical literature. Here we present 2 cases of total intrathoracic stomach with a foreshortened esophagus, cervical spine rachischisis, and splenic anomalies in newborns. Both had 46, XX karyotypes. The first case was initially treated with mobilization of the stomach into the abdomen. However, at 18 months the stomach was found to have retracted back into the thorax. Subsequently, the patient received a Collis gastroplasty and G-tube. Two-year follow-up is available. The second case exhibited the abovementioned anomalies along with absence of toes 3 and 4 on the right foot, and cardiac anomalies not compatible with life. The parents chose to withdraw support. The encountered abnormalities may be explained by a first trimester mesenchymal insult and share some similarities with the VACTERL association. In our experience, mobilization of the stomach into the abdomen without elongation of the esophagus will fail. If tolerated, the management of the intrathoracic stomach should include preoperative intragastric feedings to allow time for gastric enlargement followed by a Collis gastroplasty. The management of cervical rachischisis requires assessment of cervical spine stability and cervical immobilization. As other life-threatening birth defects may be present, thorough evaluation should be completed before counseling the families of the treatment options available.","cervical spine rachischisis, asplenia, intrathoracic stomach, neonatology, embryology"
"Product roadmapping enhances the product development process by enabling early information and long-term decision making about the products in order to deliver the right products to the right markets at the right time. However, relatively little scientific knowledge is available on the application and usefulness of product roadmapping in software product development context. This study develops a framework for software product roadmapping, which is then used to study the critical aspects of the product roadmapping process. The collection of empirical evidence includes both quantitative and qualitative data which sheds further insight into the complexities involved in product roadmapping. Results revealed that organizations view the product roadmap mainly as a tool for strategic decision making as it aims at showing the future directions of the company's products. However, only a few companies appear to have an explicit approach for handling the mechanisms for creating and maintaining such a roadmap. Finally, it is suggested that the strategic importance of product roadmapping is likely to increase in the future and, as a conclusion, a new type of agility is required in order to survive in the turbulent and competitive software business environment.","product roadmap, product roadmapping, future direction, software product management, product development, software product development context, product development process, right product, roadmapping process, software product roadmapping, volatile business environment, right time, competitive software business environment, right market, scientific knowledge, qualitative data, production management, empirical evidence"
"Sarcoidosis is a systemic non caseous granulomas disease. Liver is a common location but usually asymptomatic. Evidence based guidelines for this location treatment is lacking and the effect of corticosteroids may be inadequate. The aim of our study was to describe the clinical, biochemical, radiological and therapeutic features of seven patients with systemic sarcoidosis and liver involvement. A retrospective and descriptive monocentric study, over 3 years, including seven patients with systemic sarcoidosis and liver involvement. We included 5 women and 2 men with an average age of 43 years. Hepatic localization revealed sarcoidosis in 5 cases. Hepatomegaly was observed in all patients as well as abnormal serum liver function test reflected by anicteric cholestasis. Liver biopsy, showed in all granulomatous lesions consistent with sarcoidosis and severe fibrosis in 2 cases. Extra-hepatic manifestations were present in all patients represented mainly by pulmonary location. All patients were treated, five by corticosteroid and two with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Complete response was observed in one case, partial response in another case and corticosteroid refractoriness in one case. In two cases, corticosteroid therapy was introduced for less than 1 month, not allowing assessment of response. Antimalarials in combination with UDCA were used successfully in a patient with steroid-resistant liver disease. Liver involvement can reveal systemic sarcoidois. Given the risk of progression to severe liver disease, it must be screened in all patients with systemic sarcoidosis. Treatment is not systematic, and still based on corticosteroid therapy. In the absence of prospective randomized controlled trials, the efficacy of UDCA need to be proven.","Sarcoidosis, cholestasis, corticosteroids, granuloma, liver"

It reveals how Natural England is tackling these changes, notably with regard to establishing reconstituted nature conservation sites and re-designed coastlines. Such an approach requires the close involvement of policy leaders, agency officers, local maritime authorities and local residents. This paper explains how participatory processes play a critical role in the design of new coastlines that are ecologically and geomorphologically sustainable yet enable local communities to survive and flourish. A case study involving a visioning exercise at Winterton-on-Sea in Norfolk, UK, highlights the many practical difficulties around planning for the uncertain future of internationally important nature conservation sites, and local economies and communities. Future moves toward sustainable coastal alignments will have to involve a wide mix of public and civic bodies, as well as local communities, and will be underpinned by risk-based planning and well-researched adaptation and relocation arrangements.","coastal management, sustainable coastal governance, nature conservation, participatory shoreline planning, stakeholder engagement, land management, land use planning, sustainability"
"Scalar and vector interactions, with the scalar interaction coupled to a composite spin-1/2 system so as to cause a shift of its mass, are shown to obey a low-energy theorem which guarantees that the second order interaction due to z-graphs is the same as for a point Dirac particle. Off-shell and contact interactions appropriate to the composite system cancel and this is verified in a model of a composite fermion. The result provides a justification for the use of the Dirac equation as it has been in relativistic nuclear scattering and mean field theories.","elastic scattering, tensors, fermions, composite fermion, mathematical models, spin, scalars, differential equations, interactions, second order, mean field theory, vectors, angular momentum, dirac equation, partial differential equations"
"Resistance training is recommended by national health organizations for incorporation into a comprehensive fitness program that includes aerobic and flexibility exercise. Its potential benefits on health and performance are numerous; it has been shown to reduce body fat, increase basal metabolic rate, decrease blood pressure and the cardiovascular demands to exercise, improve blood lipid profiles, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity, increase muscle and connective tissue cross-sectional area, improve functional capacity, and relieve low back pain. Many improvements in physical function and athletic performance are associated with the increases in muscle strength, power, endurance, and hypertrophy observed during resistance training. The key element to effective resistance training is supervision by a qualified professional and the proper prescription of the program variables. Proper program design, ie, that which uses progressive overload, variation, and specificity, is essential to maximize the benefits associated with resistance training.","Resistance Training, Resistance Exercise, Basal Metabolic Rate, Resistance Training Program, Progressive Resistance Training"
"This paper describes the use of extensible markup language (XML) for electronic clinical communications in Scotland. It gives the results of the first UK project to send and receive discharge letters using XML. This pilot had the advantage of transferring readable clinical information between computer systems and giving the receiving GP choice of decoding and saving clinical and administrative data into his practice system. A number of existing clinical systems and a variety of written documents were studied. Existing trial standards, including the NHS EDIFACT, HL7v2 and CEN standard ENV 13606 were taken into consideration. The project worked with the receiving GP system supplier, GPASS, and the NHS Scotland Information and Statistics Division in defining the document type definition (DTD) for the pilot DTD. GPASS undertook production of a module for their system to parse the XML messages into the patient record on the GP system. The system allows the GP to read and print the original document and modify the content prior to storing in the practice system. SMTP e-mail messages were used for the pilot. Resulting messages were parsed into the GP system and validated by a variety of GP users. Currently there is a large scale program to develop XML Schema and web browser based communications of referrals, discharge and laboratory orders and reports.","extensible markup language, document type definition, xml schema, xml"
"In this paper, we present the results of empirical study of the effects of open source software (OSS) components reuse on software development economics. Specifically, we examined three economic factors - cost, productivity, and quality. This study started with an extensive literature review followed by an exploratory study conducted through interviews with 18 senior project/quality managers, and senior software developers. Then, the result of the literature review and the exploratory study was used to formulate research model, hypotheses, and survey questionnaire. Software intensive companies from Canada and the US were targeted for this study. The period of study was between September 2004 and March 2006. Our findings show that there are strong significant statistical correlations between the factors of OSS components reuse and software development economics. The conclusion from this study shows that software organizations can achieve some economic gains in terms of software development productivity and product quality if they implement OSS components reuse adoption in a systematic way. A big lesson learned in this study is that OSS components are of highest quality and that open source community is not setting a bad example (contrary to some opinion) so far as 'good practices' are concerned.","open source software, software intensive company, reuse, oss component, quality, software organization, oss components reuse, adoption, software process improvement, empirical study, open source adoption, software development productivity, software development economics, senior software developer, productivity, exploratory study, measurement and economics, quality management, software development"
"We propose a simple methodology for heterogeneous data collection and central repository-style database design in healthcare. Our method can be used with or without other software development frameworks, and we argue that its application can save a relevant amount of implementation effort. Also, we believe that the method can be used in other fields of research, especially those that have a strong interdisciplinary nature.The idea emerged during a healthcare research project, which consisted among others in grouping information from heterogeneous and distributed information sources. We developed this methodology by the lessons learned when we had to build a data repository, containing information about elderly patients flows in the UK's long-term care system (LTC).We explain thoroughly those aspects that influenced the methodology building. The methodology is defined by six steps, which can be aligned with various iterative development frameworks. We describe here the alignment of our methodology with the RUP (rational unified process) framework. The methodology emphasizes current trends, as early identification of critical requirements, data modelling, close and timely interaction with users and stakeholders, ontology building, quality management, and exception handling.Of a special interest is the ontological engineering aspect, which had the effects with the highest impact after the project. That is, it helped stakeholders to perform better collaborative negotiations that brought better solutions for the overall system investigated. An insight into the problems faced by others helps to lead the negotiators to win-win situations. We consider that this should be the social result of any project that collects data for better decision making that leads finally to enhanced global outcomes.","medical data repositories, long-term care for elderly, requirement elicitation, ontology building, privacy, medical software engineering, data warehouse, software engineering, requirements elicitation"
"Triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC), widely used as antibacterial agents, have been frequently detected in biosolids. Biosolids land application may introduce pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) such as TCS and TCC into the environment. Microcosm studies were conducted to investigate TCS and TCC transformation in Marietta fine loam and McLaurin coarse loam. Both compounds were spiked into the soils with and without biosolids amendment under non-sterilized and sterilized conditions and incubated aerobically at 30 degrees C for up to 100 d. In both soils, transformation of TCS followed second-order reaction kinetics, with estimated reaction rate constants of (5.27 +/- 0.920) x 10(-1) and (9.13 +/- 1.58) x 10(-2) (mg kg(-1))(-1) d(-1) for Marietta fine loam and McLaurin coarse loam, respectively. Transformation of TCC in both soils was slower than that for TCS. After 100 d, 53 +/- 1% and 71 +/- 2% of the initially added TCC and only 2.8 +/- 0.35% and 6.2 +/- 0.80% of initially added TCS remained in Marietta fine loam and McLaurin coarse loam, respectively. The transformation of both compounds were faster in the Marietta fine loam (pH 7.8; 1.8% organic matter) than in the McLaurin coarse loam (pH 4.7; 0.65% organic matter). Our result suggests that biotic processes are more of a controlling factor affecting TCS transformation, whereas abiotic processes may affect TCC transformation more significantly. Addition of biosolids to the two soils slowed the transformation of both compounds, indicating interactions between both compounds and biosolids may adversely affect their transformation in soils, an important factor that must be included in models predicting environmental fate of biosolids-associated PPCPs.","second order, organic matter, sterilization, reaction kinetics, reaction rate"
"Future medicine will be revolutionized by genomic and stem cell research, becoming predictive, preventive, and personalized. Despite the smallness of the specialty, paediatric surgery is well placed to play a determining role in this exciting development. First, paediatric surgeons are innovators and leaders. Second, paediatric surgery thrives on the multidisciplinary approach. Third, congenital anomalies provide genetic models for studies of complex diseases. Fourth, morphogenesis underpins basic understanding in development, ageing, cancer, and immunology.

"The purpose of this study is to identify the status of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) adoption and explore the influence of organizational characteristics on the CRM adoption process in the Korean fashion industry. Using Rogers' [Rogers EM. Diffusion of innovation. New York: Free Press; 1995] innovation decision process model as the conceptual basis, this study surveyed 94 Korean fashion companies to investigate the persuasion, decision, and implementation stages of CRM adoption. Organizational variables included firm characteristics (size, strategy, maturity of information system), product characteristics (category, fashion position, seasonality), and CEO characteristics (age, education). The most frequently used CRM technology is the development of a customer database, whereas the mostly frequently mentioned benefits of CRM are encouraging repurchase. Moreover, respondents' perceptions of CRM benefits affect CRM adoption, influencing the use of various CRM technologies. Organizational strategy, maturity of information system, and product category all significantly influence the adoption process. Empirical findings provide further support for the innovation decision process model developed by Rogers [Rogers EM. Diffusion of innovation. New York: Free Press; 1995] and the CRM adoption model can be used when fashion companies do strategic planning and evaluate the possibility of adopting CRM strategies.","organizational characteristics, customer relationship management (crm), adoption process, seasonality, information system, customer relationship management, strategic planning"
"Formation of biominerals commonly occurs within the context of an organic matrix composed of proteins, polysaccharides, and other macromolecules. Much has been learned about the structure of matrices and the spatial and molecular relationships between matrix and mineral. Only recently has quantitative study of matrix organization and subsequent mineralization been pursued. Here, we review findings from physical studies of matrix assembly in the system of microbial S-layer proteins and of calcium carbonate nucleation on organic templates composed of organothiol self-assembled monolayers on noble metals. Studies on S-layers reveal the importance of multistage assembly pathways and kinetic traps associated with the conformational transformations required to build the basic oligomeric building blocks of the matrix. Experimental investigations of calcium carbonate nucleation on carboxyl-terminated self-assembled monolayers combined with theoretical analyses demonstrate the applicability of classical concepts of nucleation, even when cluster-aggregation pathways are considered, and reveal the underlying energetic and structural source of matrix control over the process. Taken together, these studies highlight the ways in which matrix assembly and mineralization deviate from our classical concepts of crystallization but clearly demonstrate that the concepts of physical chemistry that date back to the days of Gibbs and Ostwald still serve us well in understanding the nucleation and growth of organic matrices and mineral phases.","Matrix assembly, Mineralization, Nucleation, S-layer proteins, Calcite"
"In this report we present data on biology, gross pathology, ultrastructure, and host range studies of a naturally occurring nucleopolyhedrovirus from the mosquito Uranotaenia sapphirina (UrsaNPV). Development of this virus was restricted to nuclei of epithelial cells in posterior midgut and distal gastric caecum. Occlusion bodies contained numerous singly enveloped rod-shaped virions. Early occlusion bodies were irregularly shaped and seemed to subsequently coalesce to form larger polyhedra. Mature occlusion bodies had a unique dumbbell shape, and lacked a polyhedron envelope and crystalline structure. Developmental and structural features of UrsaNPV were generally similar to other mosquito NPVs, with major differences in occlusion body shape and size. Transmission tests showed that only members of Uranotaenia ( Ur. sapphirina and Ur. lowii ) were susceptible to this virus. Transmission was facilitated by magnesium. Field collected Ur. sapphirina larvae had a relatively high rate of dual infections with UrsaNPV and UrsaCPV (cypovirus).","nuclepolyhedrosis, cypovirus, mosquito viral pathogens, uranotaenia lowii, dual viral infections, uranotaenia sapphirina, epithelial cell, host range, magnesium"
"Two half-cycle symmetry SHEPWM(Selected Harmonic Elimination Pulse Width Modulation) schemes are proposed for two-level inverter: positive-negative symmetry and T/2 point symmetry. As an example, the SHEPWM nonlinear equations of two-level inverter with twenty switching points per half-cycle are established and solved to thoroughly investigate the SHEPWM schemes. As the half-cycle symmetry SHEPWM scheme has multiple groups of effective solution, eight of them are listed to show the variation trajectories of its solution and modulation rate covering whole range. Simulation and experiment are carried out for two groups with modulation rate of 0.8, and the conformity of experimental results to simulative results proves the validity and practicability of the proposed schemes.","Electric inverters, Half-cycle symmetry, Pulse width modulation, Selected harmonic elimination"
"Although psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) are considered a stress-induced paroxysmal disintegration of cognitive functions, it remains unknown whether stress indeed impairs cognitive integrative functions, such as working memory (WM), in patients with PNES. An N-back task with emotional distracters (angry, happy, and neutral faces) was administered at baseline and after stress induction (Cold Pressor Test) to 19 patients with PNES and 20 matched healthy controls. At baseline, patients displayed increased WM interference for the facial distracters. After stress induction, group differences generalized to the no-distracter condition. Within patients, high cortisol stress responses were associated with larger stress-induced WM impairments in the no-distracter condition. These findings demonstrate that patients' cognitive integrative functions are impaired by social distracters and stress induction. Moreover, the stress- and cortisol-related generalization of the relative WM impairments offers a promising experimental model for the characteristic paroxysmal disintegration of attentional and mnemonic functions in patients with PNES associated with stress.","Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures, (Emotional) working memory, Social distracters, Emotional facial distracters, Stress, Salivary cortisol"
"Resource management is a central issue in operating systems design; it is even more critical in distributed systems because of the physical distribution of the resources and thus the natural redundancy and the possibility of partial failures. In this paper, we study resource management and sharing problems in distributed systems. We survey the existing distributed systems and present a taxonomy of resource management. We then propose a new approach to resource management, which we call global object management . A logically centralized systemwide manager acts as a coordinator between different parts of the system and is responsible for managing the toplevel, sharable resources in the distributed environment and making them available to the users. We argue that this approach greatly enhances system resource sharing by combining the semantic simplicity of centralized management with the reliability and availability of distributed management, and offers a number of advantages over the existing techniques.","different part, systems design, centralized management, object management, existing technique, different approach, global object management, sharable resource, new approach, system resource sharing, resource management, distributed system"
"Error flow analysis and testing techniques focus on the introduction of errors through code faults into data states of an executing program, and their subsequent cancellation or propagation to output. The goals and limitations of several error flow techniques are discussed, including mutation analysis, fault-based testing, PIE analysis, and dynamic impact analysis. The attributes desired of a good error flow technique are proposed, and a model called dynamic error flow analysis (DEFA) is described that embodies many of these attributes. A testing strategy is proposed that uses DEFA information to select an optimal set of test paths and to quantify the results of successful testing. An experiment is presented that illustrates this testing strategy. In this experiment, the proposed testing strategy outperforms mutation testing in catching arbitrary data state errors.","dynamic impact analysis, error flow, path-oriented approach, testability, fault-based testing, pie analysis, error flow analysis, dynamic error flow analysis, mutation analysis, proposed testing strategy, path distribution, successful testing, mutation testing, data state, testing strategy, software analysis and testing, fault, software analysis, marketing"
"Human-environment interactions can affect the sex ratios of resource-dependent societies in a variety of ways. Historical and contemporary data on Alaska Native populations illustrate such effects. Some eighteenth and early nineteenth century observers noted an excess of females, which they attributed to high mortality among hunters. Population counts in the later nineteenth century and well into the twentieth found instead an excess of men in many communities. Female infanticide was credited as the explanation: since family survival depended upon hunting success, males were more valued. Although infanticide explanations for the excess of males have been widely believed, available demographic data point to something else: higher adult female mortality. Finally, in the postwar years, the importance of mortality differentials seems to have faded- and also changed direction. Female outmigration from villages accounts for much of the gender imbalance among Native populations today. Natural-resource development, particularly North Slope oil, indirectly drives this migration. In Alaska's transcultural communities, the present gender imbalances raise issues of individual and cultural survival.","population dynamics, population, natural resource, ethnic groups, developed countries, sex ratio, environment, migration, cultural background"
"To determine whether altering design of a quiet room (QR) produced more rapid calming of agitated or aggressive hospitalized children.One of five similar QRs was modified by painting the white walls tea rose, carpeting the vinyl floor, and painting a picturesque mural on one wall. The effects of these modifications were assessed in 19 patients (mean age = 9.6 years), using a within-subjects, repeated-measures design. Overt Aggression ratings were made at the time of placement, and at 5-minute intervals thereafter, until the child was dismissed. Children were blind to the fact that a study was being conducted; raters and staff were not.Total aggression ratings were 45% lower in the modified QR than in the standard QR (p < .03), and initial aggression scores fell by 50% during 5 minutes of placement in the modified QR, but only after 20 minutes of placement in the standard QR (p < .0001). Motor excitement and verbal aggression were the two component factors most strongly influenced by QR design.This preliminary report suggests that it may be possible to modify QRs to facilitate calming of aggressive, agitated children and provides preliminary support for redesign of QRs.","aggression, children, agitation, seclusion, quiet room, nino"
"Pollutants originating with roof runoff can have a significant impact on urban stormwater quality. This signifies the importance of understanding pollutant processes on roof surfaces. Additionally, knowledge of pollutant processes on roof surfaces is important as roofs are used as the primary catchment surface for domestic rainwater harvesting. In recent years, rainwater harvesting has become one of the primary sustainable water management techniques to counteract the growing demand for potable water. This paper presents the outcomes of an in-depth research study into particulate matter build-up and wash-off for roof surfaces. In this research, particulate matter was considered as the indicator pollutant where the processes related to other pollutants can be predicted based on the understanding generated for particulate matter. The study outcomes confirm that the build-up process on roof surfaces is comparatively similar to road surfaces. However, particle loads collected from roofs were significantly less compared to road surfaces and much finer in texture. Wash-off from roofs also showed significant similarities to wash-off from roads. A relatively high concentration of particulate matter was noted during the initial part of storm events. Furthermore, the amount of particulate matter remaining on the roof surfaces was significantly high for less intense rain events.","rainwater harvesting, roof runoff, build-up, wash-off, rainfall simulation, particulate matter, pollutants, water harvesting, sustainability, runoff, water pollution"
"We adapted a survey instrument developed by Timothy Lethbridge to assess the extent to which the education delivered by four UK universities matches the requirements of the software industry. We propose a survey methodology that we believe addresses the research question more appropriately than the one used by Lethbridge. In particular, we suggest that restricting the scope of the survey to address the question of whether the curricula for a specific university addressed the needs of its own students, allowed us to identify an appropriate target population. However, our own survey suffered from several problems. In particular the questions used in the survey are not ideal, and the response rate was poor.Although the poor response rate reduces the value of our results, our survey appears to confirm several of Lethbridge's observations with respect to the over-emphasis of mathematical topics and the under-emphasis on business topics. We also have a close agreement with respect to the relative importance of different software engineering topics. However the set of topics, that we found were taught far less than their importance would suggest, were quite different from the topics identified by Lethbridge.","own student, survey methods, research question, timothy lethbridge, own survey, response rate, poor response rate, different software engineering topic, software engineering curricula, survey instrument, software engineering curriculum, survey methodology, relative importance, software engineering"
"Debate remains around the accuracy and prognostic implications of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for melanoma arising in the head and neck (HN) areas because several analyses have shown discordances between clinically predicted lymphatic drainage pathways and those identified by lymphoscintigraphy. This study assesses the accuracy and prognostic value of SLNB in this critical anatomic region.Retrospective review of a prospectively collected melanoma database identified 331 patients with HN melanomas from January 2000 to December 2012. Primary end points included SLNB result, time to recurrence, site of recurrence, and survival. Multivariate models were constructed for analyses.A sentinel lymph node (SLN) was identified in all 331 patients. There were 59 patients with a positive SLN (17.8%) with a recurrence rate of 88.1% compared with 22.4% in SLN-negative patients (P < 0.0001). The 5-y overall survival was 91.2% for SLN-negative patients and 48.7% for SLN-positive patients (P < 0.0001). Patients with scalp melanoma had thicker lesions and an elevated risk of SLN positivity, recurrence, and death compared with those with other sites. Among the 272 SLN-negative patients, four patients developed regional nodal disease in the same basin and had undergone a previous SLNB procedure for a false-omission rate of 1.45%. Risks for false-negative SLN occurrences included thick and scalp melanomas. Multivariate analysis on prognostic factors affecting relapse-free survival showed positive SLNB status to be the most prognostic clinicopathologic predictor of recurrence (hazard ratio, 20.56; P < 0.0001).SLNB for patients with HN melanomas is an accurate procedure and has prognostic value.","head and neck, melanoma, sentinel lymph node, survival"
"The expression pattern of miR-200a in different types of cancer is diverse, and its mechanism in tumorigenesis has yet to be elucidated. In this study, miR-200a was significantly upregulated in the cancer tumor tissues of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, and its expression was positively correlated with the degree of tumor differentiation. Overexpression of miR-200a enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. To understand the potential mechanism of miR-200a in tumorigenesis, we showed that miR-200a directly targeted phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). To test the clinical relevance of these results, we used 107 pairs of CRC and adjacent normal tissues, analyzed miR-200a levels and PTEN expression in these tissues, and found that miR-200a levels were significantly inversely correlated with PTEN levels in the cancer tissues. These results suggest that miR-200a plays an oncogene role by regulating PTEN signaling in CRC. Our findings present important implications for further understanding the signaling mechanisms involved in modulating CRC tumorigenesis.","Colorectal cancer, Immunohistochemistry, In situ hybridization, PTEN, miR-200a"
"The association between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the development of head and neck cancer has been documented recently. In this study on 86 head and neck cancer patients and 124 controls, data regarding demographics, behavioral risk factors, and risks related to HPV exposure were collected. HPV detection was carried out using polymerase chain reaction in the tumors and in oral exfoliated cells, and HPV typing by a reverse line blot assay specific for 37 HPV types. Sera were tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for HPV proteins. Head and neck cancer cases report significantly more oral-anal contact (P = 0.02) and tobacco and alcohol use than controls (P = 0.001; P = 0.02, respectively). High-risk HPV DNA was detected in 43% of oral washings of cases and 4% of controls (P < 0.0001). The association between the presence of high-risk HPV DNA in oral exfoliated cells and in tumor tissues was statistically significant (adjusted P < 0.0001). The prevalence of HPV-specific antibodies was significantly higher in cases than in controls (adjusted P < 0.0001). These results provide epidemiological and immunological evidence for HR HPV as a strong risk factor (OR = 44.3, P < 0.0001) for head and neck cancer, even after controlling for age, tobacco and alcohol use. The detection of high-risk HPV DNA in oral exfoliated cells and HPV-specific antibodies in serum can be considered as clinically relevant surrogate markers for the presence of a HPV-associated head and neck cancer, with a high sensitivity (83%) and specificity (88%).","pcr, hpv, risk factors, antibodies"
"Construction industry observers tout the use of financial incentives as promoters of motivation and commitment on projects. Yet, little empirical evidence exists concerning their effectiveness. What are the drivers of motivation on construction projects? The reasons that construction project participants are motivated to pursue voluntary incentive goals are examined through four Australian case studies. The results demonstrate the critical role played by project relationships and equitable contract conditions in promoting the effectiveness of financial incentives. In the context of a construction project, this study finds financial incentives to be less important to motivation and performance than relationship enhancement initiatives. This finding is unexpected and has implications for the design of project procurement strategies. These results suggest that if project clients ignore the importance of relationship quality between participants, the impact of any financial incentive will be compromised.","construction, projects, motivation, empirical evidence, construction industry"
"To test the external validity of the dimensions and subtypes of DSM-IV attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) by assessing the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity.Eight- to 18-year-old twins with ADHD (n = 105) and without ADHD (n = 95) were recruited through local school districts. Comorbid disorders were assessed by structured diagnostic interviews with the parent and child and by a behavioral rating scale completed by the child's classroom teacher.Symptoms of inattention were associated with lower intelligence and higher levels of depression, whereas symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity were associated more strongly with symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD). All DSM-IV subtypes were associated with higher rates of ODD and CD in comparison with controls, and the combined type was associated with more disruptive behavior disorder symptoms than the other 2 subtypes. The combined type and predominantly inattentive type were associated with more symptoms of depression than controls or the predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type.These results provide support for the discriminant validity of the dimensions and subtypes of DSM-IV ADHD and suggest that clinicians should carefully screen for comorbid disorders as part of a comprehensive assessment of ADHD.","comorbidity, validity, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, dsm-iv, external validity"
"Optimal shakedown design of metal frame and truss-like structures is considered in this paper. Strength, stiffness and stability (only for trusses) constraints are included in non-linear mathematical models of volume minimization problems of structures. Stiffness conditions are realized by the restriction of structure deflections or nodal displacements, which can vary non-monotonically during the adaptation process. Determination of displacements is especially complicated if the variable repeated load is defined by variation bounds, which are not related to time. For trusses, stability constraints are related to recommendations of Eurocode 3 (EC3). Numerical examples concerning the calculation of frame and truss structures are presented. The results are valid for the small displacement assumptions.","trusses, frames, mathematical programming, optimal shakedown design, mathematical model"
"Taiwan is a heavily populated country, with a small land area and many mountains and isolated islands. Because medical resources are unequally distributed, high quality accessible medical care is a major problem in rural areas. Medical personnel are unwilling to practice in rural areas because of fear of isolation from peers and lack of continuing medical education (CME) in those areas. Telemedicine provides a timeless and spaceless measure for teleconsultation and education. The development of telemedicine in Taiwan began under the National Information Infrastructure (NII) Project. Distance education and teleconsultation were the first experimental projects during the initiation research stage. The cost and effectiveness of the hardware and network bandwidth were evaluated. In the promotion research stage, applications in different medical disciplines were tested to promote multipoint videoconference, electronic journals and VOD. Investigation of user satisfaction put on more emphasis on improving application functions. In 1998, a new Cyber Medical Center (CMC) international collaboration project was begun, integrating technologies of multimedia, networking, database management, and the World Wide Web. The aim of the CMC is to create a multimedia network system for the management of electronic patient records, teleconsultation, online continuing medical education, and information services on the web. A Taiwan mirror site of Virtual Hospital and two international telemedicine trials through Next Generation Internet (NGI) were done at the end of 1998. In the future, telemedicine systems in Taiwan are expected to combine the Internet and broadband CATV, ADSL, and DBS networking to connect clinics, hospitals, insurance organizations, and public health administrations; and, finally, to extend to every household.","distance education, world wide web, public health, database management, rural area"
It received wide attention of the plasma enhance ignition. Shock tube is important equipment for the measurement of hydrocarbon fuel ignition. The schlieren system was adopt to observe the flow field in the shock tube. The influence of the discharge in low pressure section in the shock tube for incident and reflect shock wave was studied. The influence after adding three kinds of electrodes was studied. The variation of the flow field before and after the discharge was discussed. The results show that the mace type with plane end face electrode would produce bigger influence to the incident and reflect shock wave. The mace type with point end face electrode would produce little influence to the flow field and the influence of the needle type electrode could be ignored. The influence the corona discharge did to the flow field could be ignored compared with and without the discharge,"Shock tube, Corona discharge, Schlieren, Shock wave"
"The main objective of the present study was to determine the effects of arm tasks possessing varying degrees of static and dynamic components upon the physiological and psychophysical strain imposed on the human body. Heart rate and blood pressure were used as indices of cardiovascular strain, while ratings of perceived exertion and endurance time are used as indices of psychophysical strain. For each weight of load studied, static tasks recorded the highest systolic blood pressure, dyastolic pressure, and ratings of perceived exertion values followed by combined, then highly dynamic, tasks. The highly dynamic task recorded the highest endurance time followed by combined then purely static tasks. This study supports the idea that blood pressure should be incorporated as one of the monitored strain factors in setting criteria for manual materials-handling tasks. In addition, the ratings of perceived exertion can be used as an effective tool in assessing the static component of the task. Based on the results obtained from the experimental conditions studied, the weight of the load has been shown to be an important parameter in the design of arm tasks comprising varying degrees of static and dynamic components. On the other hand, the frequency of handling is not an important parameter in the design of these types of tasks.","Physiological effects, psychophysical assessment, materials handling, arm tasks"
"ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are members of a multigene family of 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that are regulatory components in several pathways of intracellular vesicular trafficking. The relatively small (approximately 180-amino acids) ARF proteins interact with a variety of molecules (in addition to GTP/GDP, of course). Cholera toxin was the first to be recognized, hence the name. Later it was shown that ARF also activates phospholipase D. Different parts of the molecule are responsible for activation of the two enzymes. In vesicular trafficking, ARF must interact with coatomer to recruit it to a membrane and thereby initiate vesicle budding. ARF function requires that it alternate between GTP- and GDP-bound forms, which involves interaction with regulatory proteins. Inactivation of ARF-GTP depends on a GTPase-activating protein or GAP. A guanine nucleotide-exchange protein or GEP accelerates release of bound GDP from inactive ARF-GDP to permit GTP binding. Inhibition of GEP by brefeldin A (BFA) blocks ARF activation and thereby vesicular transport. In cells, it causes apparent disintegration of Golgi structure. Both BFA-sensitive and insensitive GEPs are known. Sequences of peptides from a BFA-sensitive GEP purified in our laboratory revealed the presence of a Sec7 domain, a sequence of approximately 200 amino acids that resembles a region in the yeast Sec7 gene product, which is involved in Golgi vesicular transport. Other proteins of unknown function also contain Sec7 domains, among them a lymphocyte protein called cytohesin-1. To determine whether it had GEP activity, recombinant cytohesin-1 was synthesized in E. coli. It preferentially activated class I ARFs 1 and 3 and was not inhibited by BFA but failed to activate ARF5 (class II). There are now five Sec7 domain proteins known to have GEP activity toward class I ARFs. It remains to be determined whether there are other Sec7 domain proteins that are GEPs for ARFs 4, 5, or 6.","brefeldin a, sec7 domain, adp-ribosylation factor, guanine nucleotide-exchange protein, cytohesin-1, nucleotides, phospholipase d, functional requirement, gtpase activating protein, adp ribosylation factor, amino acid, binding protein, enzyme"
"Howard, Dexter H. (University of California, Los Angeles). Intracellular growth of Histoplasma capsulatum. J. Bacteriol. 89:518-523. 1965.-Under a variety of experimental conditions, the generation time of Histoplasma capsulatum in mammalian histiocytes was remarkably constant. The rate of intracellular growth of five different isolates of H. capsulatum was very similar. The generation time of the fungus within guinea pig cells was nearly the same as it was within mouse cells under comparable conditions. Preliminary exposure of yeast cells to specific antibodies and complement did not affect intracellular proliferation of the fungus during the first 24 hr after phagocytosis by mouse histiocytes. The rate of growth of the fungus within cells from immunized mice and guinea pigs was comparable to that in cells from normal animals. This latter result was not altered by preliminary exposure of the fungus to hyperimmune serum and complement.","complement, experimental lab study, guinea pigs, histiocytes, histology, histoplasma, immune serums, mice, phagocytosis, tissue culture"
"Striking differences were found in the compartmentalization of fatty acids into liver lipid fractions. The saturated fatty acids--lauric, myristic, palmitic and stearic--were incorporated into phosphoglycerides at faster rates with increasing chain lengths, while triglyceride incorporation was almost uniform. The degree of incorporation of the unsaturated fatty acids into phosphoglycerides (structural) compared to triglyceride (storage and energy) was the converse of their oxidation rates. The incorporation of oleic, linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids was mainly into triglyceride, whereas dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid and arachidonic acid were preferentially incorporated into phosphoglycerides. The data suggest that distribution of each fatty acid is different depending on its destination for structural or energy function.","biosynthesis, body, fatty acid, digestive system, radioisotopes, isotopes, phosphorus, metabolism, rodents, in vivo, distribution"
"As an alternative to bladder mucosa, free grafts of tubularized peritoneum were used as urethral substitutes in a rabbit model of hypospadias. In group 1, six mature rabbits underwent partial penile urethrectomy followed by interposition of a 2-cm-long peritoneal-lined tube graft. These animals had urethrograms performed at 3 months and were killed at 6 (n = 4) or 12 (n = 2) months. In group 2, six rabbits underwent total penile urethrectomy with placement of 3-cm-long grafts. These animals were killed 1 to 4 weeks after surgery. Clinical assessment and gross examination of the 12 rabbits showed no urinary retention, two small fistulas at the proximal anastomosis, and no strictures or diverticula. At 6 and 12 months (group 1) the urethra had healed completely and the graft edges were not visible. In group 2, 1 to 4 weeks after surgery the graft was intact and the interface between the graft and native urethra was visible. Histological studies of the grafts were compared with control peritoneum. At 1 week, a high-density single-cell layer was present. Beginning at 2. weeks, a multilayered epithelium was present, which became more organized in the older grafts. Neovascularity became visible in the subepithelial layer at 2 weeks. Acute inflammatory cells were present early and were replaced by a palisading layer of lymphocytes and plasma cells in the older grafts. Minimal fibrosis was observed. Tubularized peritoneal free grafts are a promising new urethral substitute. Graft placement is technically simple. Replacement of the peritoneum by a multilavered epithelium resembling transitional epithelium occurs early after graft placement. As much as 1 year later, minimal scarring is present.","rabbit model, hypospadias, peritoneum, urethra"
"The nonlinear dynamic boiler model of 300MW power unit is given which is derived from mass and energy balance relationship. The parameters of the model can be obtained from the physical dimensions and characteristics of the boiler. The inputs of the model are feedwater valve position, steam valve position, fuel valve position, and feedwater temperature, the outputs of the model are drum pressure, water level, main stream flow. The model can be used for synthesis of model-based control algorithms of boiler system. It can also be used for setting up a real-time simulator for testing new boiler control system and operator training.","Boiler model, Dynamic study, Nonlinear, Power plant"
"The presence of the two forms of enolase, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and non-neuronal enolase (NNE), have been examined in biopsy material of human neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, ganglioneuroma and cultured neuroblastoma cells, after separation with ion exchange chromatography. The enolase activities were inhibited in the presence of NaCl but remained active in KCl, which were used in the chromatographic step. The relative NSE levels in the neuroblastoma tissues were found to be lower than in the histopathologically more differentiated forms of the tumour, i.e. ganglioneuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma. The human neuroblastoma in vitro cell lines SK-N-SH, SH-SY5Y, SK-N-MC and IMR-32 contained considerably lower relative levels of NSE compared to the levels in the neuroblastoma biopsies. After treatment of the cultured cells with nerve growth factor or dibutyryl-cAMP some cells showed morphological differentiation and concomitantly an increase in the NSE levels. The results indicate that NSE might be useful as a marker for differentiation in human neuroblastoma.","ganglioneuroblastoma, human, ganglioneuroma, neuron-specific enolase (14-3-2), differentiation, neuroblastoma, neuron specific enolase"
"Abstract The inpatient psychiatric treatment and 1-year follow-up of a recidivist child firesetter with multiple clinical and behavioral problems is described. This case was unique due to the child's young age and both the severity and frequency of firesetting. The focus of therapy was on teaching fire safety skills and concepts to alter the child's interest in and involvement with fire. Other elements of the therapy targeted associated antisocial behavior and depression. At 1-year follow-up, the child had not engaged in additional firesetting. This case highlights the need to provide a comprehensive assessment of firesetting, understand its relationship to psychopathology, and offer specialized interventions.","firesetting, antisocial behavior, recidivist firesetter, inpatient treatment"
An experiment is described to measure the distracting effects of advertisements on the conspicuity of routing signs in realistic scenes. Slides of railway station scenes were shown in which subjects had to search for a target word used in a routing sign present in the scene. Eye movements were recorded to determine search time and number of fixations during search time. Both search time and number of fixations increased systematically with the number of advertisements in two of the three experimental scenes. The distribution of fixations over the scenes is discussed.,"Eye movement, route information, signs, conspicuity"
"In recent years, a number of studies have considered the application of chaos theory to economics; the primary focus, however, has been the implications for stock prices, the foreign exchange market, and the macroeconomy. This paper describes a non-linear model of duopolistic competition, which focuses on a firm's expenditure and the resulting quality or technological endowment of its product. Results from computer iteration of the model are presented which indicate that chaotic outcomes are possible for a range of competing managerial policies; the associated unpredictability is due solely to the dynamics of the interaction. The study also provides the results of some initial work on how management adaptation may act to forestall chaotic outcomes.","non-linear dynamics, chaos, economics, r&d, competition, chaos theory, modeling and simulation, foreign exchange market, non linear dynamics"
"Child Behavior Checklists completed by parents of 50 children of each sex at each age from 4 to 16 seen in 28 American and 21 Dutch mental health services (N = 2,600) were examined. Analyses controlling for sex, age, and socioeconomic status showed somewhat higher total problem scores for American than Dutch children, with a mean of 57.27 versus 53.18 on a scale ranging from 0 to 240. This nationality difference accounted for less than 1% of the variance in total scores. American children obtained higher scores on more externalizing items than Dutch children. Small but significant differences in total, externalizing, and internalizing problems found between the two samples may reflect nationality differences in referral patterns. Competence scores were significantly higher for American than Dutch referred children, but did not differ as much as in comparable normative samples. Competence scores may reflect cultural differences more than problem scores do.","child behavior checklist, epidemiology, child/adolescent psychopathology, crosscultural analyses, parent reports"
"The relationship between the equivalent barrier height of ZnO-Bi2O3 based varistor ceramics and normalized applied voltage was studied and it was found that the equivalent barrier height is influenced by normalized voltage greatly. With the increase of normalized voltage, the equivalent barrier height increases firstly, then changes little and finally decreases quickly. Because the Schottky barrier height at the reverse-biased side is higher than that at the forward-biased side, the equivalent barrier height is determined by the former. The changing trend of the equivalent barrier height with normalized voltage indicates three steps of conduction. Firstly, in low normalized voltage range the velocity of electron injection from the forward-biased barrier area into the amorphous layer at grain-boundary is lower than that of ejection from traps in the amorphous layer into the reverse-biased barrier area. Thus the equivalent barrier height increases with the growth of normalized voltage. Secondly, in medium normalized voltage range, the injection velocity and the ejection velocity of electron are equal and the equivalent barrier height reaches its maximum value. Finally, in high normalized voltage range the injection velocity of electron is quicker than the ejection velocity of electron and the equivalent barrier decreases with the increase of the normalized voltage. In the end, the Schottky barrier will break electrically. At the same time, the relationship between the equivalent barrier height and the leakage current was analyzed and it was found that the leakage current is determined by an exponential function of the difference between the equivalent barrier heights when normalized voltage is 1 and 0.75.","Conduction process, Equivalent barrier height, Normalized voltage, ZnO varistor ceramics"
"A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism has been developed and used to study the oxidation of cyclohexane at both low and high temperatures. Rules for reaction rate constants are developed for the low-temperature combustion of cyclohexane. These rules can be used for in chemical kinetic mechanisms for other cycloalkanes. Because cyclohexane produces only one type of cyclohexyl radical, much of the low-temperature chemistry of cyclohexane is described in terms of one potential energy diagram showing the reaction of cyclohexyl radical with O2 through five-, six-, and seven-membered-ring transition states. The direct elimination of cyclohexene and HO2 from RO2 is included in the treatment using a modified rate constant of Cavallotti et al. (Proc. Combust. Inst. 2007, 31, 201). Published and unpublished data from the Lille rapid compression machine, as well as jet-stirred reactor data, are used to validate the mechanism. The effect of heat loss is included in the simulations, an improvement on previous studies on cyclohexane. Calculations indicated that the production of 1,2-epoxycyclohexane observed in the experiments cannot be simulated according to the current understanding of low-temperature chemistry. Possible ""alternative"" H-atom isomerizations leading to different products from the parent O2QOOH radical were included in the low-temperature chemical kinetic mechanism and were found to play a significant role.","chemical kinetics, transition state, rate constant, heat loss, reaction rate, potential energy, reaction kinetics, kinetics"
"Venture capitalists seek investment opportunities in young, privately-held companies with promising growth prospects. In addition to supplying capital, venture capitalists are decision-making agents who participate in the governance of their ventures and attempt to influence objectives, strategy, structure, and control processes. This study develops and evaluates models examining the impact and relative importance of venture-capitalist factors, managerial strategy, industry structure variables, and their interactions on performance of venture capital-backed organizations. The models are evaluated based on their ability to predict whether the VC-backed venture will provide superior long-term performance.","logit models, venture capitalists, strategic decision-making, initial public offerings, initial public offering, venture capitalist, venture capital, logit model"
"This study examines brand attitude formation process by ad execution format (emotional vs. informational). For ads with an emotional ad format, heightening positive feelings and reducing negative feelings enhanced thoughts about credibility of the ad, which in turn affected ad attitudes and brand attitudes. For ads with an informational ad format, enhancing evaluative thoughts about the credibility of the ad enhanced positive feelings and reduced negative feelings. These variables in turn affected brand attitudes, both directly, and through the mediational influence of ad. These results have relevant theoretical implications for studying the various processes by which brand attitudes are formed and have managerially relevant implications regarding advertising copy-testing.","credibility, brand attitudes, ad attitudes, attitude formation processes, advertising execution, feelings"
"Large carpenter bees (the genus Xylocopa), as an important group of bees (Apidae), are common visitors to flowering plants in tropics and subtropics. Their foraging behavior is characterized by long season of activity, high diversity of foraging plants, tolerance of high temperatures, activity under low illumination levels, and buzz pollination. These traits make them to be attractive pollinators for agricultural pollination in hot climates, especially in greenhouses, night-blooming plants, and some Solanum. In recent years, large carpenter bees have been demonstrated have efficient pollination service in blueberries, passion flower, runner bean, greenhouse tomatoes and greenhouse melons in foreign countries. However, evidence for their importance and effectiveness as crop pollinators is lacking for most plant species in China. This article reviewed the research progress on foraging behavior and pollination of Xylocopa, with the aim to provide a theoretical basis for the conservation management and utilization of large carpenter bees.","Xylocopa, foraging behavior, nectar robbing behavior, pollination"
"Scholars show continuing interest in top management teams (TMT). This line of research emphasizes their importance for organizational success. This study reveals a clear challenge for researchers; to better understand the relationships between TMT characteristics and firm performance, researchers should consider the firm's environment. Results suggest that environmental complexity moderates the relationship between TMT strategic consensus and performance in Mexican companies. Interestingly, the results contradict initial expectations; lower levels of consensus correlate with higher performance in simple, more than in complex environments. Higher levels of consensus correlate with higher performance, in complex environments.","environmental complexity, top management team (tmt), strategic consensus, firm performance"
"Academic research has made significant advances in the generation of test sequences from formal specifications, and in the development of computer-aided test tools, with the aim of improving the effectiveness of protocol testing. However, this state-of-the-art research is not necessarily state-of-the-practice; these methods and tools are seldom used in the computer and communications industries. There is a big gap between testing practice and research results published in journals and reported at conference. To help the industrialization of academic techniques, empirical studies and a new orientation towards real issues need to be given higher priority by researchers, and real-life test coverage and field experience need to be more frequently reported [66]. This paper presents a literature survey of communication protocol testing. We have focused our survey on the following five areas: test sequence generation methods, test coverage, fault model and prediction, test tools, and experience reports.","protocol testing, computer-aided test tool, communication protocol testing, test tool, academic research, research result, test coverage, test sequence generation method, real-life test coverage, test sequence, communication protocol, field experiment, empirical study, fault model"
"The feeding activity of domesticated and wild rats was studied. The rats obtained all their food by lever pressing in two-lever operant chambers. Concurrent variable interval (VI) and concurrent variable ratio (VR) schedules operated continuously for successive 4-day periods. Feeding occurred as regular, discrete meals, mostly during the night. The schedules did not affect the number or size of meals or the total amount eaten. The interval schedules significantly extended the duration of meals and reduced intermeal intervals. Lever pressing was characterised on concurrent VI schedules by low response rates and frequent alternation and that on concurrent VR schedules by higher response rates confined to one lever. The wild rats ate significantly more than the domesticated rats by increasing the number but not the size of meals, primarily during the night. Feeding behaviour and operant responding are discussed in relation to the effects of domestication and economy of effort in food-seeking. The inhibition caused by handling and food deprivation, which impairs the performance of wild rodents in short sessions is avoided by providing self-maintenance conditions.","domestication, feeding, operant conditioning, variable interval, variable ratio, rat (wild)"
"Continuous pavement deflection profiling in a nondestructive manner has received great attention because of its efficiency in pavement evaluation. The Rolling Dynamic Deflectometer (RDD) is a continuous pavement deflection profiling technology and has demonstrated its successful use at many pavement projects. However, RDD's current test speed of 1.6 km/h (with the prototype rolling sensor) often limits its use in large-coverage projects and traffic congested areas. Increasing the test speed creates a higher-noise environment, lowered signal-to-noise ratio, and sensor decoupling with the ground surface. This study presents the enhancement to the RDD for increased test speed, associated with the new design of the lower-level rolling sensor and higher-performance digital filter and data processing. The new sensor along with the enhanced data processing could increase the spatial resolution of the deflection data, which allows the increase of the test speed of the RDD.","continuous deflection profile, data processing, rolling dynamic deflectometer, rolling sensor"
"A total of 150 samples, 50 each of beef, lamb and pork from 10 local retail stores in Brisbane metropolitan area as well as 150 raw bovine bulk milk tank samples obtained from Queensland United Foods (QUF), were examined for the presence of Aeromonas and Listeria spp. over a period of 1 year. Different sets of enrichment and plating media were used to recover the organisms with subsequent identification using conventional biochemical and serotyping techniques. A total of 509 isolates consisting of Aeromonas spp. (350) and Listeria spp. (159) were obtained from 60%, 58%, 74%, 26.6%, 34%, 40%, 30%, 2.6% of samples of beef, Lamb, pork and milk respectively. Motile aeromonads (A. hydrophila, A. sobria, A. caviae) and Listeria innocua were isolated from all kinds of samples whereas L. monocytogenes was only isolated from flesh food. A. hydrophila contributed the largest percentage of the motile aeromonads (60%). The majority of L. monocytogenes cultures were serotype 4.","meat, aeromonas, milk, listeria"
"Present approximate second order methods for the analysis of frames with sway are not capable of reflecting the transition from sway to partially braced, and nearly fully braced behaviour of individual columns in the frames. The main aim of the paper is to extend the approximate storey magnifier approach to account for such a transition. The key to this is in the manner local second order effects are reflected. A high order shear relationship is proposed, and general sway magnifier, critical load and effective length formulations are presented both in terms of first order lateral storey stiffness and critical, free-sway column loads. Their interrelationship, and simplifications leading to existing approaches, and adaptations in present codes and standards, are discussed. Comparisons are made with exact critical loads, sway and moment magnifiers for nearly unbraced, partially braced and nearly fully braced systems. The proposed, extended approach provides predictions that generally are in very good agreement with exact results at all axial load levels. The more simplified approaches provide good agreement for low to moderate load levels for some column end restraint combinations, and up to relatively high load levels for other combinations.","critical load, columns, storey magnifier method, frames, effective lengths, storey-based buckling, second order, first order, second order approximation"
"The Mackey-Grass (MG) equation is of infinite dimension and possesses any number of positive Lyapunov exponents. However, the MG equations can be synchronized with a sporadic driving and that the drive period can be selected over a wide range. This paper presents a new method for chaotic communication using the MG equations synchronized with a sporadic driving signal. Chaotic modulation and demodulation are realized using numeric integration with the chaotic carrier serving as the driving signal transmitted over a digital channel. The chaotic communication system is applied to speech communication with analysis of the selection of the drive period and the input information signal amplitude. Simulation results showed that the communication system with the proposed parameters is very secure with the same transmission rate and transmission quality as conventional digital speech communication systems.","Chaotic communication, Digital communication, Mackey-Grass systems, Speech communication"
"Using phase separation micromolding (PSmicroM) we developed porous micro-patterned sheets from amorphous poly(1,3-trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC). The use of these PTMC sheets can be advantageous in tissue engineering applications requiring highly flexible constructs. Addition of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) in various amounts to PTMC casting solutions provides PTMC sheets with tailored porosity and pore sizes in the range 2-20 microm. The pore-forming effect of PEO during the phase separation process is evaluated and glucose transport measurements show that the pores are highly interconnected. Additionally, tailoring the micro-pattern design yields PTMC sheets with various surface topographies. Cell culturing experiments with C2C12 pre-myoblasts revealed that cell attachment and proliferation on these sheets is relatively high and that the micro-pattern topography induces a clearly defined cell organization.","Phase separation, Poly(trimethylene carbonate), Tissue engineering scaffold, Cell attachment and proliferation, Micro-patterning"
"In this paper an elitist genetic algorithm (GA) developed by the authors is compared with common commercial solutions for complex structural optimization. After its prior validation on two-dimensional (2D) structures, the GA was tuned and improved in order to obtain structural elements with minimum weights that satisfy the ultimate limit states of the applicable building code. Subsequently, the same spatial structures were optimized using a commercial structural analysis program. Finally, the cost and weight improvements obtained using the GA, although at a higher computational cost, are discussed.","minimum weight, design optimization, elitist genetic algorithm, ultimate limit states, three-dimensional steel structures, genetic algorithm, complex structure, satisfiability, three dimensional, structure analysis"
"Bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles loaded with paclitaxel (PTX) were prepared using a desolvation technique. A 32 full factorial design (FFD) was employed to formulate nanoparticles. Nanoparticles were characterized for particle size by photon correlation spectroscopy and surface morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Encapsulation efficiency, zeta potential and particle yield were also determined. Response surface linear modelling (RSLM) was used to predict the optimal formulation. Various models were applied to determine the release mechanism from PTX nanoparticles. The effect of drug-polymer ratio on the release profile of formulations was observed and was applied to determine the suitability of the predicted optimal formulation. A preliminary study to determine the feasibility of targeting the prepared nanoparticles to brain was also carried out using mice as in vivo models.","paclitaxel, bovine serum albumin, nanoparticles, desolvation, brain targeting, factorial design"
"A multitude of opinions has been propounded to explain how the Internet can be exploited by commercial organisations. For the most part, they are speculative, visionary, or promotional. This work seeks to redress the balance by reporting on an empirical research project that has recently been conducted into the adoption of the Internet within the UK retail sector. More specifically, the research reports on the application of multivariate statistical techniques to a set of questionnaire responses, with a view to critically evaluating the factors that affect the adoption of the Internet. It has been shown that certain factors are far more significant than others in influencing the adoption decision. In particular, it has been demonstrated that operating in an appropriate market sector and having a positive view of the viability of the Internet are of particular significance. Furthermore, the importance of developing a coherent and integrated Internet strategy, the need for senior management commitment, and the presence of an appropriate infrastructure and development capability are also highlighted.","internet adoption, retailing, united kingdom, internet, multivariate statistics, empirical research"
"This paper deals with a semilinear parabolic system with coupled nonlinear nonlocal sources subject to weighted nonlocal Dirichlet boundary conditions. We establish the conditions for global and non-global solutions. It is interesting to observe that the weight functions for the nonlocal Dirichlet boundary conditions play substantial roles in determining not only whether the solutions are global or non-global, but also whether (for the non-global solutions) the blowing up occurs for any positive initial data or just for large ones.","weight functions, nonlocal sources, 35b33, blow-up, nonlocal boundary conditions, parabolic system, 35k60, weight function, dirichlet boundary condition"
"This study compares the energy dissipative characteristics of bolted t-stub connections using steel and shape memory alloy (SMA) fasteners. The initial phase of the study focused on the optimization of the SMA superelastic effect using two different heat treatment temperatures. The samples were then subjected to tensile testing to determine transformation stress, tensile strength, and fracture strain. In addition, low cycle fatigue tests were conducted to examine the energy dissipative characteristics of these superelastic SMAs heat treated at the two temperatures. The cycled samples were then tensile tested to determine the effect of fatigue cycling on transformation stress, tensile strength, and fracture strain. Results from the mechanical tests were analyzed to determine the preferred heat treatment temperature that resulted in the least residual strain and the largest energy dissipative characteristics. The second phase of the study involved t-stub connection testing using steel and SMA double-ended threaded rod fasteners. The optimum heat treatment determined in the first phase was used to develop the SMA fasteners for the t-stub connection tests. Experimental hysteresis results from the t-stub connection tests were used to compare the energy dissipation capacity of the connections with SMA and steel fasteners.","t-stub connections, steel connections, hysteresis, shape memory bolts, cyclic tests, shape memory alloy, tensile test, energy dissipation, heat treatment, tensile strength, shape memory"
"The indication for fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains a subject of debate, partly because of questions concerning its diagnostic accuracy compared to ultrasound, partly because of practical factors such as accessibility, high costs and available expertise. Most studies advocate an added value for MRI in cases diagnosed with central nervous system pathology. MRI is a good modality to detect small foci of brain hemorrhage, to depict callosal anomalies, to add information about normal and pathological cortical development, and is a more sensitive imaging method to detect white matter pathology. This manuscript discusses the role of MRI as an adjunct to ultrasound for cases diagnosed-- with cerebral ventriculomegaly.","fetal, hydrocephaly, magnetic resonance imaging, ventriculomegaly, bioinformatics, biomedical research"
"This paper argues that the structural, relational and cognitive dimensions of social capital within retail stores provide an insight into the antecedents of customer service orientation and store creativity. These three dimensions enhance a customer service orientation as a result of increased knowledge sharing, creation of information channels, and the facilitation of cooperative behavior. Secondly, because these factors foster the process of resource exchange and combination, they are also associated with an increased level of store creativity. Indeed, for a high level of creativity to take place at the store level, knowledge has to be shared and combined in an effective manner. Our proposed model is tested on a sample of 112 stores within a large national retail chain. We find partial support for our hypothesized model.","retail stores, customer service orientation, creativity, social capital theory, social capital, three dimensions"
"The use of concrete filled steel box columns has been consistently applied in the design of tall buildings as they provide considerable economy in comparison with conventional steel columns. Their use allows the adoption of steel or composite floor systems combined with economically constructed columns. The use of these columns also has considerable advantages over reinforced concrete columns as they allow higher percentages of reinforcement to be adopted. In basements of tall buildings where car park space is of premium cost, a reduction in the column size can provide significant economic benefits. The use of high strength steel can be applied in these situations. This paper provides an extensive set of experiments on high strength steel box columns filled with concrete. A numerical model is presented and calibrated successfully with these tests. Furthermore, comparisons with the Eurocode 4 model for composite columns are also undertaken in this paper and this is found to be unconservative in its prediction of axial and combined strength. A mixed analysis technique is therefore presented, which treats the concrete as rigid plastic and the steel as linear elastic. This model is calibrated well with the numerical model presented and both of these models are found to be conservative in predicting the test results.","composite columns, high strength steel, steel columns, welded columns, box columns, local buckling, internal standard, residual stress, residual stresses, design methodology, linear elasticity"
"Anti-Ki (Ku, p70/p80) autoantibodies, named after the prototype patient Kikuta by Tojo et al., occur in approximately 10% of patients with SLE, often in association with anti-Sm autoantibodies. The immunofluorescent staining pattern characteristic of anti-Ki antibodies is diffuse speckled nuclear, although some substrates show nucleolar staining as well. Anti-Ki sera specifically immunoprecipitated two protein antigens, Ki86 (Mr 86,000) and Ki66 (Mr 66,000), from radiolabeled cell extracts. The Ki system was found to be immunologically identical to the Ku system described by Mimori et al. and the p70/p80 system described by Reeves. The Ki primary in vitro translation products were identified and proved similar in size to the cellular antigens. The Ki antigens were purified from human spleen by immunoaffinity chromatography followed by SDS-PAGE. The purified Ki antigens proved to be closely related by amino acid composition, and did not appear to be phosphorylated, glycosylated, or associated with RNA. The Ki antigens were found to bind to DNA, in agreement with the observations on the Ku and p70/p80 antigens. They were found to be widely conserved in mammals and were coordinately expressed in all tissues tested. Anti-Ki autoantibodies were purified by antigen-affinity chromatography and were tested by immunoblotting. The antibodies were classified as class I, II, or III, depending on their reactivity with the Ki antigens in immunoblots. Class I antibodies cross-reacted with both Ki antigens, class II antibodies reacted solely with Ki66, and class III antibodies reacted solely with Ki86. These results suggest that at least three different epitopes are present on the Ki autoantigens and that patients differ in their autoantibody response to each epitope.","electrophoresis, radioimmunoassay, antigens, phosphorus, phosphorus 32, isotopes, sulfur isotopes, amino acids, chromatography, radioisotopes, body, infectious disease, nucleic acids, sulfur 35, phosphorus isotopes, molecular weight, amino acid, lupus, beta decay, dna, immunology"
"Sir: In the review paper of Gray (1), dealing with chemical tests for oxidation of oils, the limitations of many of the various tests are discussed. In the very short section in this review paper on ""Organoleptic Evaluation,"" it states that: ""Ultimately these results (i.e., results from chemical tests) must support the sensory measurements."" Methodology for measuring rancidity by sensory methods is not clearly described. In fact, the reader might imply that sensory methods are so lacking in ""reproducibility, sensitivity, and quantitativeness"" as to be unsuitable for use by a scientist. In the experience of this writer which he has pointed out (2) when using any of the rancidity tests such as TBA or peroxide value, at least for fish oils, for any selected degree of rancidity the chemical value may vary considerably. This variation in value will depend upon such factors as the storage temperature during development of rancidity or whether an antioxidant was present or not. Any prudent scientific investigator will need to check the values of whatever chemical test or tests he is using against a scientifically designed sensory test involving the use of a trained sensory panel. Such ""calibration"" of the chemical values corresponding to different degrees of rancidity will need to be repeated especially where differing storage conditions prevail.","Thermal Decomposition, Sensory Evaluation, Chemical Test, Sensory Panel, National Marine Fishery"
"This paper describes an accurate finite element model for the structural performance of cold-formed high strength stainless steel columns. The finite element analysis was conducted on duplex stainless steel columns having square and rectangular hollow sections. The columns were compressed between fixed ends at different column lengths. The effects of initial local and overall geometric imperfections have been taken into consideration in the finite element model. The material nonlinearity of the flat and corner portions of the high strength stainless steel sections were carefully incorporated in the model. The column strengths and failure modes as well as the load-shortening curves of the columns were obtained using the finite element model. Furthermore, the effect of residual stresses in the columns was studied. The nonlinear finite element model was verified against experimental results. An extensive parametric study was carried out using the verified finite element model to study the effects of cross-section geometries on the strength and behaviour of cold-formed high strength stainless steel columns. The column strengths predicted from the parametric study were compared with the design strengths calculated using the American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and European Code for cold-formed stainless steel structures. The results of the parametric study showed that the design rules specified in the American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications are generally conservative for cold-formed high strength stainless steel square and rectangular hollow section columns, but unconservative for some of the short columns.","duplex, columns, steel structures, stainless steel, rectangular hollow sections, square hollow sections, high strength, cold-formed steel, buckling, finite element, modeling, residual stress, design rules, finite element analysis, failure mode, finite element model, cross section"
"Two large-scale edge slab-column connections with T-shaped columns were tested under combined gravity and cyclic lateral loads, in order to study cracking behavior, failure mode, concrete strain, steel strain, as well as the seismic behavior of hysteresis loops and displacement ductility. The two specimens were identical except one contained shear-stud reinforcement. Test results revealed that the seismic behavior of edge slab-column connection with T-shaped column is similar to that of conventional edge slab-column connection with square column except there are some differences in the punching shear behavior between them, the ultimate drift ratios of the two specimens are all well above 1.5%, indicating that it is feasible to use T-shaped column in flat slab structures. The results also confirmed the effectiveness of shear-stud reinforcement in increasing the shear strength and ductility of this kind of connection. The critical section of punching shear for edge T-shaped column and the equation for the analogous to polar moment of inertia are suggested, thus the code procedure can be used to analyse the slab-column connection with T-shaped column, which is justified by results of tests.","Pseudo-static test, Seismic performance, Shear-stud reinforcement, Slab-column connection, T-shaped column"
"More than 3 million people in the United States have atrial fibrillation, most of whom are being managed with anticoagulation therapy for life. The goal of the present study was to examine the effect of chronic anticoagulation therapy on patients with atrial fibrillation who undergo total joint arthroplasty.We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing aseptic primary or revision total joint arthroplasty at our facility from March 2007 to August 2011. One hundred and sixty-one patients with atrial fibrillation (Group A) were compared with 161 matched controls (Group B). A total of 112 hips and 210 knees underwent 239 primary arthroplasties and eighty-three revisions. The groups were compared with use of conditional logistic regression (with matching on the basis of the involved joint [hip or knee], type of procedure [revision or primary], age, and sex) with regard to the length of hospital stay, postoperative hemoglobin levels, transfusion requirements, and readmissions.The preoperative length of stay (1.7 versus 0.2 days; p < 0.0001), postoperative length of stay (4.6 versus 3.2 days; p = 0.0002), and total length of stay (6.3 versus 3.4 days; p < 0.0001) were significantly longer for patients with atrial fibrillation (Group A). Hemoglobin levels were lower (but not significantly so) for Group A at baseline (13.1 versus 13.8 mg/dL), on Postoperative Day 2 (10.1 versus 10.6 mg/dL), on Postoperative Day 3 (9.8 versus 10.2 mg/dL), on Postoperative Day 4 (9.6 versus 10.1 mg/dL), on Postoperative Day 5 (9.7 versus 9.9 mg/dL), and at discharge (9.9 versus 10.3 mg/dL). Group A had a significantly higher prevalence of blood transfusion (15.5% versus 3.7%; p = 0.0005) and periprosthetic joint infection (5.6% versus 0.62%; p = 0.0196). A diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 4.09; 95% confidence interval, 2.05 to 8.18; p < 0.0001) significantly increased the odds of total joint arthroplasty complication and the need for hospital readmission.Patients with preoperative atrial fibrillation undergoing total joint arthroplasty had an increased length of hospital stay, increased transfusion requirements, and an increased risk of periprosthetic joint infection and unplanned hospital readmission.","risk, prevalence, case control studies, retrospective studies"
"Stapled anastomoses of the gastrointestinal tract, commonplace in adults and older children, are rarely performed in newborns because of the size of the instruments. The development of smaller stapling devices for laparoscopic and thoracoscopic procedures presented an opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of such anastomoses in neonates and infants. Over an 11-month period, seven newborn or young infants underwent stapled functional end-to-end small or large intestinal anastomoses using the Endo-GIA 30. The male:female ratio was 3:4, and the mean age was 72d (range, 1 to 134 days). The mean weight at the time of the stapled anastomosis was 3.7 kg (range, 1.88 to 6.6 kg). The clinical setting requiring the intestinal anastomoses included ileostomy closure after perforated necrotizing enterocolitis (3), intestinal atresia (1), distal ileal volvulus (1), left colon mesenteric cyst (1), and biliary atresia (1). There were no deaths or anastomotic leaks. Nasogastric decompression was discontinued at a mean of 6 days (range, 3 to 11 days), and oral feedings were begun at a mean of 7.0 days (range, 4 to 12 days). The patients were discharged from the hospital 7 to 117 days after the operation (mean, 33 days). The endoscopic stapling instrument is safe and effective in performing small and large intestinal anastomoses in newborns and young infants.","neonate, infant, intestinal anastomosis, surgical stapling"
"In this paper, a novel subspace coherent signal processing algorithm for high-resolution direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is proposed, which is based on forward-backward averaging and subspace eigendecomposition, the FB-SED algorithm for short. The forward-backward averaging matrix is employed as the preprocessor for the linear arrays, and then the invariance property of noise subspace to power emitters is used to estimate the directions of the coherent sources. The simulation results indicate that the FB-SED algorithm provides higher resolution performance for two closely spaced coherent sources estimation compared to conventional forward backward spatial smoothing MUSIC (FBSS-MUSIC). Finally, it is shown that FB-SED algorithm is more robust than FBSS-MUSIC when there are array errors in the practical linear array","subspace coherent signal processing algorithm, linear arrays, matrix algebra, direction of arrival estimation, forward backward spatial smoothing music, noise subspace, direction-of-arrival estimation, forward-backward averaging matrix, subspace eigendecomposition, high-resolution doa estimation, eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, power emitters, signal processing, high resolution, direction of arrival"
"A case study on the potential of enhancing gasoline production was carried out by analyzing the components of gasoline pool in this study and the specifications of gasoline products. It was obvious that gasoline blending components from FCC unit and CCR unit were the dominant components. Thus measures, such as providing more feedstocks for FCC and CCR units, maximizing the production load of these two units, and recycling heavy CCR gasoline fraction to FCC unit were adopted. Successful results showed that the production of gasoline increased by 172. 6 kt (over the design value) in 2010, which indicated an economic benefit of 86. 13 million RMB was obtained.","Catalytic cracking, Continuous reforming, Gasoline, Production optimization"

"This study here examines the role of absorptive capacity as both a mechanism to identify and translate external knowledge inflows into tangible benefits, as well as a means of achieving superior innovation and time-lagged financial performance. Using path analysis in a sample of 461 Greek enterprises participating in the third Community Innovation Survey, this study demonstrates that external knowledge inflows are directly related to absorptive capacity and indirectly related to innovation. Absorptive capacity contributes, directly and indirectly, to innovation and financial performance but in different time spans. This study, therefore, contributes to the understanding of absorptive capacity's antecedents and outcomes by providing empirical evidence of longitudinal form that offers important research and practical implications.","financial performance, innovation, time-lagged measures, absorptive capacity, external knowledge inflows, path analysis, empirical evidence"
This paper presents a model-based methodology called DESIGNOR to support design decisions for new industrial products. Models and measurements are developed to assess the relationship between product features and market potential. The methodology incorporates a measurement survey for model calibration and leads to empirical tradeoff curves between design dimensions. The approach handles discrete as well as continuous features and can be incorporated into a procedure aimed at finding a profit maximizing design. It can be used to support decisions concerning product design as well as for product line expansion. The approach provides a consistent way of evaluating market potential for new industrial products and presents important advantages over other product design methodologies.,"decision support, industrial production, new product, product design"
"Despite success of several techniques described for pectus excavatum repair, a minority of patients require multiple reoperations for recurrence or other complications. We aimed to review our experience in reoperative pectus excavatum repairs and to identify features correlating with need for additional reoperations.Charts were reviewed of all patients undergoing reoperative pectus excavatum repair for 3 years at a university-based children's hospital. Number and type of previous repairs, time between operations, lengths of stay, analgesia, and complications were recorded.From February 2004 to December 2007, 170 pectus excavatum repairs were performed. Among these, 27 were reoperative. Overall, 18.2% of reoperative patients required subsequent additional reoperations. 21.1% of patients undergoing repeat open repairs and 33.3% of patients undergoing repeat minimally invasive repairs required further operative interventions. There was no need for additional repairs among patients who had open repairs after minimally invasive repairs, nor for any patients who had minimally invasive repairs after open repairs.We conclude that patients with failed open repairs will have better success with minimally invasive reoperations, whereas patients with failed minimally invasive repairs will have better success with open reoperations. When faced with reoperative pectus excavatum, we recommend consideration of an alternative operative approach from the initial procedure.","nuss procedure, reoperation, leonard procedure, ravitch procedure, recurrence, pectus excavatum"
"A one-year-old female goat presented with acute onset of recumbency, seizures and vocalisation approximately 5 hours after being given access to branch trimmings from a neighbour's garden. The plant from which the pruned branches came was subsequently identified as wintersweet (Chimonanthus praecox). Three other goats kept in the same paddock displayed similar clinical signs over a period of 4 hours following the initial presentation.All four goats were ataxic, displayed tetanic seizures and were in lateral recumbency; they had dilated pupils and were hyperaesthetic, with elevated heart and respiratory rates. After symptomatic treatment, including sedation with diazepam, one of the three goats continued to deteriorate and was subjected to euthanasia. The remaining three goats recovered over 1-14 days with nursing care and physiotherapy.Toxicity due to ingestion of wintersweet, which contains the alkaloid calycanthine.Calycanthine is a central nervous system toxin, causing convulsions.

The result is to a large extent dictated by the assumption of a fixed volume flux through the Florida Straits. There is no fundamental discrepancy between oceanic heat fluxes deduced from atmospheric residuals and those estimated directly in the ocean, including the estimates made here, simply because the error bars on all calculations are very large.","heat flux, heat transfer, wind energy, flow rate, mathematical model"
"The agent development paradigm poses many challenges to software engineering researchers, particularly when the systems are distributed and open. They have little or no control over the actions that agents can perform. Laws are restrictions imposed by a control mechanism to deal with uncertainty and to promote open system dependability. In this paper, we present a high level event-driven conceptual model of laws. XMLaw is an alternative approach to specifying laws in open multi-agent systems that presents high level abstractions and a flexible underlying event-based model. Thus XMLaw allows for flexible composition of the elements from its conceptual model and is flexible enough to accept new elements.","flexible composition, flexible underlying event-based model, open system dependability, open multi-agent system, high level abstraction, event-driven, agent development paradigm, conceptual model, control mechanism, interaction laws, multi-agent systems, electronic institutions, open systems, governance, event-driven conceptual model, high level, event-driven high level model, multi agent system, software engineering, multi agent systems, event driven, open system"
"In this work the nonlinear in-plane behavior of circular arches with hollow circular cross-section is investigated. The influence of a number of design parameters, such as the boundary conditions, the rise-to-span ratio, and the included angle on the strength is presented. Moreover, the effect of other behavior factors, such as the geometrical and material nonlinearities and the initial imperfections, is investigated. A criterion for the prediction of the type of nonlinear behavior of arches is given, and a formula for the determination of the nonlinear buckling load is proposed. It is found that the effect of initial imperfections on the strength depends largely on the arch slenderness and the imperfection magnitude in the case of shallow arches. When arches are deep this dependence becomes less significant. The effect of geometrical nonlinearity depends significantly on the shallowness and the slenderness of the arches. Stocky arches are less influenced by the rise-to-span ratio than slender ones. The effect of boundary conditions depends significantly on the shallowness of arches and the arch slenderness. The reduction of strength is larger in slender arches than in stocky ones.","Snap-through, Circular arches, Nonlinear buckling, Steel, Strengths, Bifurcation"
"Broadcasting is the natural method of propagating information in wireless links, which guarantees scalability in the case of bulk data transfers. It is particularly attractive for resource limited mobile clients in asymmetric communications. To facilitate power saving via wireless data broadcast, index information is typically broadcast along with the data. By first accessing the broadcast index, the mobile client is able to predict the arrival time of the desired data. However, it suffers from the drawback that the client has to wait and tune for an index segment, in order to conserve battery power consumption. In location-aware mobile services (LAMSs), it is important to reduce the query response time, since a late query response may contain out-of-date information. This paper proposes a new broadcast-based spatial query processing method, called BBS designed to support NN query processing. In the BBS, broadcasted data objects are sorted sequentially based on their locations, and the server broadcasts the location dependent data along with an index segment. In this method, since the data objects broadcasted by the server are sequentially ordered based on their location, it is not necessary for the client to wait for an index segment, if it has already identified the desired data items before the associated index segment has arrived. The performance of this scheme is investigated in relation to various environmental variables, such as the distributions of the data objects, the average speed of the clients and the size of the service area.","mobile client, data item, adaptive data dissemination scheme, broadcasted data object, mobile computing, location-aware mobile service, index, associated index segment, broadcast index, bulk data transfer, wireless data broadcast, data object, location dependent data, wireless data broadcasting, index segment, indexation, data dissemination, data transfer, mobile computer"
"This study assessed and compared oral health and oral-health behaviours among children with and without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The study included 31 children, 12-18 yr of age, with ADHD and 31 age- and gender-matched children without ADHD. Clinical data were recorded by a trained and calibrated examiner for caries, traumatic dental injuries, periodontal health, tooth wear, and salivary function. A questionnaire was also given to parents or caregivers about the oral health habits and behaviours of these children. Data were compared using Mann-Whitney U-tests and chi-square tests. No significant differences were found between children, with or without ADHD, in caries extent or prevalence, dental trauma prevalence, prevalence of periodontal disease or plaque, tooth wear, or unstimulated salivary flow. Children with ADHD had a significantly higher percentage of sites with gingival bleeding, as well as a higher frequency of parent-reported dislike of dentists, bruxism, history of assisted toothbrushing, and toothbrushing duration <1 min. They also had higher attendance at government dental clinics. The findings indicate that children with ADHD have poorer oral hygiene and more adverse oral-health attitudes and behaviours than do children without ADHD.","attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, caries, children, oral health, periodontal health"

"Some industries mostly include diversified firms, while specialized firms dominate other industries. This study analyzes what factors affect the dominance of diversified versus specialized firms. In line with transaction cost economics, we show that market concentration and the degree of variability in the diversification pattern of firms in the industry are negatively associated with the overall extent of activities accounted by specialized firms across the 720 industries in our study. We also discuss the implication of these results for the literature on firm diversification.","firm diversification, specialized firm, diversified firm, transaction cost economics"
"Joint linear beamforming and scheduling are performed in a system where limited feedback is present at the transmitter side. The feedback conveyed by each user to the base station consists of channel direction information (CDI) based on a predetermined codebook and a scalar metric with channel quality information (CQI) used to perform user scheduling. In this paper, we present a design framework for scalar feedback in MIMO broadcast channels with limited feedback. An approximation on the sum rate is provided for the proposed family of metrics, which is validated through simulations. For a given number of active users and average SNR conditions, the base station is able to update certain transmission parameters in order to maximize the sum-rate function. On the other hand, the proposed sum-rate function provides a means of simple comparison between transmission schemes and scalar feedback techniques. Particularly, the sum rate of SDMA and time division multiple access (TDMA) is compared in the following extreme regimes: large number of users, high SNR, and low SNR. Simulations are provided to illustrate the performance of various scalar feedback techniques based on the proposed design framework.","low snr, scalar feedback technique, high snr, proposed design framework, average snr condition, limited feedback, base station, mimo broadcast channel, sum rate, various scalar feedback technique, scalar feedback"
"According to most studies, more than half of children exposed to war meet criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although we know that children are adversely affected by atrocities of war, we do not know which specific war events are associated with children's stress reactions. For example, it is unclear whether differences exist in response to violent versus nonviolent war-trauma experiences. This study examined the relationship of violent and nonviolent war experiences to children's trauma reactions and adjustment in a group of children from Bosnia.During the 1994 siege in Sarajevo, 791 children aged 6 to 16 years participated in a study of trauma experience and response, in which assessment questionnaires (Impact of Event Scale, PTSD Reaction Index, Children's Depression Inventory, Child Behavior Checklist, and War Experience Questionnaire) were completed by children and their teachers.In this sample 41% had clinically significant PTSD symptoms. Children were adversely affected by exposure to both violent and nonviolent war-traumas. An additive effect of trauma exposure on trauma reactions was also found. However, many war experiences were not associated with children's adjustment and trauma reactions.Additive effects of violence and deprivations during war may overwhelm the coping skills of children and leave them vulnerable to externalizing and internalizing adjustment difficulties and symptoms of PTSD.","violence, posttraumatic stress disorder, trauma, children, war, occupational safety, ergonomics, injury prevention, human factors, suicide prevention"
"We have continued our assessment of the ability of nicotinamide to sensitize tumours to radiation. Using the SCCV11 carcinoma and estimating tumour response by either a regrowth delay or an in vivo/in vitro survival assay, it was found that a large single dose of nicotinamide (1000 mg/kg) increased radiation-induced tumour damage. This effect was observed regardless of whether the tumour was grown intramuscularly, subcutaneously or intradermally, or whether the nicotinamide was administered intra-peritoneally, intravenously or orally. The enhancement was maximal when the drug was given between 30 min and 2 h prior to irradiation and resulted in enhancement ratios ranging from 1.1 to 1.7. Although the radiation response of tumours was dependent on tumour size, the radiation enhancement produced by nicotinamide was not. Utilizing the technique of labelling tumour cells with the fluorescent stain Hoechst 33342, we were able to identify the presence of both chronic and acutely hypoxic cells in this tumour model and obtained results suggesting that apart from reducing chronic hypoxia, nicotinamide may also have the ability to decrease the level of radioresistant acute hypoxia.","nicotinamide, in vivo, sccvii tumour, radiosensitization, acute and chronic hypoxia, radiation damage"
"The elastic buckling load is physically important in design because it is actually the critical step in the changing plate configuration that will eventually lead to complete failure. The present work investigates the problem of linear buckling of simply supported thin plates subjected to patch compression. In order to satisfy the boundary conditions in a rigorous way, the authors chose the finite element method using the exact stress distribution throughout the plate. In the present paper, the stability problem treated using the total energy is briefly outlined. The plate modelling is made by means of an eight noded rectangular element and a reduction of variable strategy is applied to estimate the number of degrees of freedom leading to little or no loss in seeking solution accuracy. The buckling coefficient is determined for different load cases applied to a range of plate with various edge ratios. The achieved results are summarised through different graphs representing variation of the buckling coefficient against the plate ratio for each load case treated. A comparison with previous works is made. Finally, it is shown that the resolution of the plate buckling problem using true stress distribution with the finite element method leads to a good agreement with results previously obtained by means of analytical methods using an exact stress distribution.","finite element method, patch compression, thin plates, linear buckling, degree of freedom, boundary condition, finite element analysis, satisfiability"
"The polarization effects in tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) refractometers are investigated theoretically. The polarization effects may degrade the sensor performance greatly, and should be considered to achieve high-precision surrounding refractive index (SRI) measurement. The possible paths to reduce the influence of polarization effects are discussed. For large SRI changes, the cutoff resonance wavelength can be used as sensing parameter to achieve a polarization insensitive SRI measurement with linear sensitivity of ~500 nm/u.r.i and SRI uncertainty of ~10-3 over SRI range of 0.1; for tiny SRI changes the measurement can be refined by monitoring proper individual resonance (close to the cutoff resonance wavelength) with accuracy approaching 2.5 ?? 10-5 over a SRI range of 0.001.","Wavelength measurement, Resonance, Fiber gratings, Bragg gratings, Optical fiber sensors, Optical fiber polarization, Page description languages, Refractive index, Optical refraction, Optical fiber theory"
"In the current design method for steel I beams with circular web openings, the load carrying capacities of the beams is assumed to be limited by the formation of plastic hinges at the top tee-sections at the low moment side of the web opening. Moreover, a linear interaction formula is used to assess the moment capacity of the tee-sections above and below the web openings under co-existing axial and shear forces. The method is regarded as conservative since the formation of plastic hinges in the top tee-sections at the low moment side of the web openings does not always cause failure. The beams are capable of carrying additional load until four plastic hinges at critical locations of the perforated sections are developed to form a Vierendeel mechanism. Moreover, the reduction in the moment capacities of the tee-sections under coexisting axial and shear forces is less severe than that anticipated by the linear interaction formula. The paper presents an investigation of the Vierendeel mechanism in steel beams with circular web openings based on analytical and numerical studies. The current design method is examined in detail with plastic hinges formed at the low moment side (LMS) and the high moment side (HMS) of the web openings separately. A finite element model is then established with both material and geometrical non-linearity so that load redistribution across the web openings may be incorporated. Moreover, the moment capacities of the tee-sections above and below the web openings may be properly evaluated in the presence of co-existing axial and shear forces in the finite element model. The load carrying capacities of typical universal steel beams with circular web openings are also presented and discussed. An empirical shear moment interaction curve at the perforated sections is also suggested for practical design of steel beams with circular web openings against the Vierendeel mechanism. It is found that shear yielding in steel beams with circular web openings is very important as it promotes the plastic hinge formation at the high moment side of the web opening. Such effect is less significant in steel beams with rectangular web openings where the bending moment is often dominant.","finite element analysis, material and geometric non-linearity, design development, shear moment interaction curves, circular web opening, carrying capacity, design method, finite element model, shear force"
"Despite a much higher rate of human influenza A (H7N9) infection compared to influenza A (H5N1), and the assumption that birds are the source of human infection, detection rates of H7N9 in birds are lower than those of H5N1. This raises a question about the role of birds in the spread and transmission of H7N9 to humans. We conducted a meta-analysis of overall prevalence of H5N1 and H7N9 in different bird populations (domestic poultry, wild birds) and different environments (live bird markets, commercial poultry farms, wild habitats). The electronic database, Scopus, was searched for published papers, and Google was searched for country surveillance reports. A random effect meta-analysis model was used to produce pooled estimates of the prevalence of H5N1 and H7N9 for various subcategories. A random effects logistic regression model was used to compare prevalence rates between H5N1 and H7N9. Both viruses have low prevalence across all bird populations. Significant differences in prevalence rates were observed in domestic birds, farm settings, for pathogen and antibody testing, and during routine surveillance. Random effects logistic regression analyses show that among domestic birds, the prevalence of H5N1 is 47.48 (95% CI: 17.15-133.13, P < 0.001) times higher than H7N9. In routine surveillance (where surveillance was not conducted in response to human infections or bird outbreaks), the prevalence of H5N1 is still higher than H7N9 with an OR of 43.02 (95% CI: 16.60-111.53, P < 0.001). H7N9 in humans has occurred at a rate approximately four times higher than H5N1, and for both infections, birds are postulated to be the source. Much lower rates of H7N9 in birds compared to H5N1 raise doubts about birds as the sole source of high rates of human H7N9 infection. Other sources of transmission of H7N9 need to be considered and explored.","H5N1, H7N9, avian influenza, birds, prevalence"
"In the context of a program in Health Information Science at the University of Victoria in Victoria, BC, Canada, we have over the past 20 years made progress and gained experience in delivering a number of courses in a project-based experiential learning mode which links professionals and students in real world projects. As we are moving towards distance education, we are facing the challenge of translating these achievements into distance mode. The paper reviews the principles which make project-based educational mode involving collaboration with professionals desirable. We then review the experience with two specific courses, in which local students work with distant and local representatives of health institutions, respectively, on projects defined in the professional environment. This experience showed that the approach is of mutual interest and benefit to both the students and the professionals involved, but that a long lead time, and considerable detail in the preparation are required to lead such endeavors to success. We then discuss three alternatives to translating the principles of these approaches into distance mode. Among the alternatives, conducting a local project, closely affiliated with the teaching institution, or relying on a mock project which is based on recorded examples from previous projects, seem to be the most promising options. The alternative of having every student pursuing a different project, which may be local for the student but distant for the educational institution, is less attractive if faculty are expected to assume responsibility for successful project completion. It may, however, be the preferred solution if students are health professionals residing at distant health care institutions. All three alternatives have drawbacks that may limit the feasibility of project-based experiential learning in distance mode.","experiential learning, health care, distance education, medical informatics"
"In vertebrates, stressors such as starvation or predator attacks stimulate the rapid elevation of circulating glucocorticoid hormones, triggering physiological and behavioral responses that aid immediate survival but simultaneously inhibit reproduction. This stress response has been proposed to serve as a physiological mediator of life-history trade-offs: when the value of current reproduction is high relative to the value of future reproduction and survival, a mitigated stress response is expected to enable successful breeding and maximize fitness. Using phylogenetic comparative analyses, we investigated baseline and peak stress-induced plasma corticosterone levels during parental care in 64 bird species. We found that (1) species with a higher value of the current brood relative to future breeding mounted weaker corticosterone responses during acute stress, and (2) females in species with more female-biased parental care had weaker corticosterone responses. These results support the brood value hypothesis, suggesting that the stress response evolves as an adaptive basis for life-history strategies. Further, we found that (3) baseline corticosterone correlated positively with brood value and negatively with body mass, and (4) peak corticosterone was greater in species breeding at higher latitudes. The latter findings suggest that circulating corticosterone concentrations might be matched to the anticipated demands and risks during nesting.","brood value, com- parative method, corticosterone, birds., evolution, life history, comparative method"
"Problematic fermentations are commonplace and cause wine industry producers substantial economic losses through wasted tank capacity and low value final products. Being able to predict such fermentations would enable enologists to take preventive actions. In this study we modeled sugar uptake kinetics and coupled them to a previously developed stoichiometric model, which describes the anaerobic metabolism of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The resulting model was used to predict normal and slow fermentations under winemaking conditions. The effects of fermentation temperature and initial nitrogen concentration were modeled through an efficiency factor incorporated into the sugar uptake expressions. The model required few initial parameters to successfully reproduce glucose, fructose, and ethanol profiles of laboratory and industrial fermentations. Glycerol and biomass profiles were successfully predicted in nitrogen rich cultures. The time normal or slow wine fermentations needed to complete the process was predicted accurately, at different temperatures. Simulations with a model representing a genetically modified yeast fermentation, reproduced qualitatively well literature results regarding the formation of minor compounds involved in wine complexity and aroma. Therefore, the model also proves useful to explore the effects of genetic modifications on fermentation profiles.","cell growth, temperature, metabolic network, fermentation, simulation models, fermentation process, kinetics, nitrogen, metabolism"
"The contents of nucleic acids and rDNA were estimated during the development of carrot cell suspensions cultured under two different conditions. The cells transferred from stock culture to the medium without 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) induced the embryogenesis (embryogenic culture), while the cells inoculated to the medium with 0.2 mg/l 2,4-D did not form any embryos (non-embryogenic culture). The ratio of RNA to DNA of both cultures increased in the early stage of the culture. The rise of the ratio in embryogenic culture was much higher than that in non-embryogenic culture, which showed that embryogenic culture accumulated RNA prior to the formation of embryos. The rDNA amount of non-embryogenic culture remained constant throughout the culture period. Although embryogenic culture showed a slight change in rDNA amount, the differences were at most 12% and the quantitative stability of the rDNA was demonstrated during the development of carrot cell suspension cultures.","sodium lauryl sulfate, 2, somatic embryogenesis, 4-d, ssc, rdna, sls, daucus carota, standard sodium citrate buffer, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, ribosomal dna"
"Utilizing a multi-dimensional measure of perceived environmental uncertainty (PEU), we investigate both similarities and differences between services and manufacturing with respect to the impact of PEU (risk) on their international entry mode strategies. We hypothesize that due to unique product characteristics and modes of delivery, (1) for certain types of PEU (government/political, product market), services and manufacturing will respond similarly, while (2) services will respond quite differently from manufacturing to other particular types of perceived risk. The hypotheses were generally supported, showing that the use of a multi-dimensional measure of PEU is important in gaining a better understanding of strategic behavior in different industries.","risk, entry mode, empirical, perceived risk"
"A number of studies have consistently found that a mother's mental health (particularly her level of depression) is a strong predictor of mental health problems experienced by her child(ren). However, the validity of this finding is in doubt because the majority of these studies have relied on maternal reports as indicators of children's behavior.This prospective, longitudinal study examines data on the mental health of the mother from prior to the birth of her child to when the child reaches 14 years of age. Child behavior is measured at 14 years of age using reports from mother and child. Mother and child responses are compared to provide an indication of the possible magnitude of maternal observation bias in the reporting of child behavior problems.Anxious and/or depressed mothers tend to report more cases of child behavior problems than do their mentally healthy counterparts or children themselves. Differences between mothers and youths in reporting behavior problems appear to be related to the mothers' mental health.Current maternal mental health impairment appears to have a substantial effect on the reporting of child behavior problems by the mother, thereby raising questions about the validity of reports of child behavior by persons who are currently emotionally distressed.","child behavior, validity, bias, anxious/depressed mothers, hierarchy, psychiatry, distortion, pediatrics, mental health, self report, agreement, anxiety"
"In order to achieve gob-side entry retaining with flexible filling body (filling gangue) under condition of hard and direct roof, uniaxial compression characteristics of sacked gangue body are gained by experiment, combined with the establishment of lateral overlying strata's constructional model alongside gob side entry retaining, static load caused by overlying strata movement is quantitatively calculated. Dynamic effect of constructional model of roof is studied by means of dynamics, and dynamic load is quantitatively calculated. Thus, when filling width is designed as 2 meters, static load of filling body is 816 kN/m, and dynamic load is 257.3 kN/m with limestone's fracture near the coal wall. Supporting demand of static load and dynamic load are satisfied by flexible filling body.","Dynamic load, Experiment, Flexible filling, Gob side entry retaining, Hard roof"
"Implantable vascular access devices (ports) are well accepted in the management of many pediatric conditions. Modifications have improved port function, patient satisfaction, and enhanced compatibility with imaging studies. We reviewed our experience with a port system and identified unique mechanical complications.From 1998 to the present, 301 patients underwent 296 port insertions and 175 port removals. We assessed medical records, radiographs, and operative findings. The 6.6F MRI Low-Profile Implanted Port (Bard Access Systems, Salt Lake City, Utah) was used almost exclusively and was assembled by the operating surgeon. Outcome measures included port reservoir leakage, catheter dislodgment, and number of device days until complication. Ports were implanted for multiple medical problems including 74.2% in hematology/oncology patients.For 296 port insertions, 15 complications (5.1%) were identified in 13 patients (mean age, 8.4 years). Eleven leaks (3.7%) in 9 patients were found, with 9 leaks resulting from needle perforation of the port base and 2 leaks seen at the catheter connection site. Average port duration was 425 days (range, 12-1266 days) before leakage. Four patients had catheter dislodgment (1.4%), with 3 of 4 catheters embolizing to the heart or pulmonary artery. Patients were asymptomatic, and catheters were retrieved by interventional radiology. Dislodgment at the catheter-port connection site was seen in 3 of 4 cases, and average port duration was 1075 days (range, 269-2657 days) until catheter separation. Twelve of 13 patients had successful implantation of a new port system.This study identifies that (1) mechanical port complications (5.1%) are not rare for this device; (2) regardless of port age, the thin plastic base may result in a risk of perforation not seen in other devices; (3) the extended period before embolization likely indicates device wear rather than faulty assembly; and (4) complications could be successfully managed including retrieval of embolized catheters.","complications, portacath, vascular access, children"
The main purpose of this paper is to describe ways to improve the microstructure of expansive soil by adding nanomaterials. Mechanical tests were done to explore the changes in shear strength and compression index of expansive soil that was modified by adding different amounts of two kinds of nanomaterials (nano-alumina and nano-silica). The test results show that adding 1.2% nano-alumina and about 2% nano-silica to expansive soil provides the optimal compression index. The test results show that adding 1.2% nano-alumina and about 1.5% nano-silica to expansive soil provides the optimal unconfined compression stress. Scanning electron microscopy of the microstructure of expansive soil modified by nanomaterials provided a deeper understanding of the effects of nanomaterials on improving expansive soil.,"Expansive soil, Nanomaterial, Nano-alumina, Nano-silica"
"Noroviruses belong to a genus of genetically diverse viruses within the family Caliciviridae and cause acute gastroenteritis in humans and animals. They are subdivided into genogroups, each of which further segregates into genotypes. Until recently, a new genotype was based on a defined pairwise distance cutoff of complete VP1 sequences, but with the increasing number of available norovirus sequences, this cutoff is no longer accurate, and sequences in the public database have been misclassified. In this paper, we demonstrate that the pairwise distance cutoff method can no longer be used and outline a phylogenetic approach to classify noroviruses. Furthermore, we propose a dual nomenclature using both ORF1 and VP1 sequences, as recombination is common and recognizing recombinant viruses may be relevant. With the continuing emergence of new norovirus lineages, we propose to coordinate nomenclature of new norovirus genotypes through an international norovirus working group.","Typing Tool, ORF2 Sequence, Capsid Sequence, Standard Deviation Criterion, Orphan Cluster"
"A 36-mo-old boy with Milroy's Disease, intestinal lymphangiectasia, and an exudative enteropathy (EE), was shown to have four colonic polyps. A large adenomatous polyp was excised from the transverse colon in an effort to control his EE and hypoalbuminemia (1.95 g/dl). His clinical status then stabilized until age 50 mo when there was a marked exacerbation of his EE. Medical management resulted in a temporary stabilization of his condition. A partial resection (40 cm) of the visually worse affected jejunum was performed. There was no improvement in the EE as measured by 51 Cr-tagged albumin study; however, his clinical response was dramatic. In the 10 mo since surgery, he has been well and has shown catchup in linear growth.","intestinal lymphangiectasia, colonic polyps, milroy's disease, protein-lowing enteropathy"
"Symbiotic dinoflagellates transfer a substantial amount of their photosynthetic products to their animal hosts. This amount has been estimated to represent up to 90% of the photosynthetically fixed carbon and can satisfy in some instances the full respiratory requirements of the host. Although in several cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbioses glycerol is the primary photosynthetic product translocated to the host, the mechanism for its production and release has not been demonstrated conclusively.Using Symbiodinium cells in culture we were able to reproduce the synthesis and release of glycerol in vitro by employing an inductor for glycerol synthesis, osmotic up-shocks. Photosynthetic parameters and fluorescence analysis of photosystem II showed that the inductive conditions did not have a negative effect on photosynthetic performance, suggesting that the capacity for carbon fixation by the cells was not compromised. The demand for glycerol production required to attain osmotic balance increased the expression of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate and of glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, possibly competing with the flux of fixed carbon necessary for protein synthesis. In longer exposures of cultured Symbiodinium cells to high osmolarity, the response was analogous to photoacclimation, reducing the excitation pressure over photosystem II, suggesting that Symbiodinium cells perceived the stress as an increase in light. The induced synthesis of glycerol resulted in a reduction of growth rates.Our results favor a hypothetical mechanism of a signaling event involving a pressure sensor that may induce the flux of carbon (glycerol) from the symbiotic algae to the animal host, and strongly suggest that carbon limitation may be a key factor modulating the population of symbionts within the host.","medicine, biology, engineering, physics, chemistry"
"The strength capacity of a reticulated spherical dome is generally associated with inelastic buckling of its slender members and more often of the partially restrained connections between members. These instability aspects were focused in the theoretical and experimental work performed to analyze the structural behaviour and to design the strengthening details to upgrade a large steel double-layer reticulated spherical dome. The paper outlines the main steps taken on the extensive stability and safety analyses of the as-built structure. Moreover it reports on the most relevant findings from tests carried out on a full-scale model of a typical substructure module, to investigate the collapse mechanisms displayed by the buckling-prone connections. A proposal is made for the use of a simple and rational expression to estimate the connection strength in the first designing stages. Finally, it is shown how structural upgrading was done by strengthening a few of the semi-rigid connections with specially designed fit-in bolted reinforcement details.","partially restrained connection, structural strengthening, steel structure, local instability, reticulated spherical dome, inelastic buckling, double layer"
"Although interactivity has become inexorably linked to personal computing and the Internet, other communication technologies provide interactive options, too. Many of these alternative technologies are complementary to Internet usage in that their reach includes populations that lack regular PC-based Internet access. Among the challenges facing these communication technologies is finding ideal combinations of entertainment and information features that can be applied to service and work needs in a sufficiently attractive manner so as to justify the considerable supply-side and consumer investment in infrastructure, software, and equipment. Understanding interactivity in entertainment potentially has additional value in helping explain barriers to adoption of nonentertainment interactive media, such as electronic shopping, telework, distance learning, telemedicine, and smart house technology.","social effects, entertainment, interactivity, internet, internet access, communication technology, distance learning, interactive media"
"This research examines the uninformed responses consumers offer to telephone surveys. Consumers in a random sample of 946 households freely offered opinions about fictitious government agencies and consumer brands for which they were uninformed. Pressuring consumers to respond through verbal introductory statements to the survey and not offering a Don't Know (DK) option led to significantly higher uninformed response rates. Further, increased pressure to respond resulted in more negative responses, and fewer positive responses. If consumers are willing to offer opinions on fictitious issues or brands, they are likely to offer opinions on actual issues or brands about which they are uninformed or unfamiliar.","telephone surveys, uninformed response bias, consumers, response rate, random sampling, response bias"
"This paper introduces the concept of politically motivated brand rejection (PMBR) as an emergent form of anti-consumption behavior. PMBR is the refusal to purchase and/or use a brand on a permanent basis because of its perceived association to a particular political ideology that the consumer opposes. Specifically, the paper discusses three distinct sets of political ideologies that can lead to rejection of certain brands by some consumers. These ideologies include predatory globalization, chauvinistic nationalism, and religious fundamentalism. The target of PMBR can be both local and global brands and consumers who engage in PMBR do not expect any change in marketing practice.","Anti-consumption, coca cola, boycott, brand rejection, political consumption, anti-consumption, Coca Cola, Brand rejection, Turkey, turkey, Political consumption, Boycott"
"Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) is a multisubunit transcription factor that when activated induces the expression of genes encoding acute-phase proteins, cell adhesion molecules, cell surface receptors, and cytokines. NF-kappaB is composed of a variety of protein subunits of which p50-and p65-kDa (RelA) are the most widely studied. Under resting conditions, these subunits reside in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex bound by inhibitor proteins, IkappaB alpha and IkappaB beta. On activation, IkappaB is phosphorylated by IkappaB kinase and ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome; simultaneously, the active heterodimer translocates to the nucleus where it can initiate gene transcription. In the periphery, NF-kappaB is involved in inflammation through stimulation of the production of inflammatory mediators. The role of NF-kappaB in the brain is unclear. In vitro, NF-kappaB activation can be either protective or deleterious. The role of NF-kappaB in ischemic neuronal cell death in vivo was investigated. Adult male rats were subjected to 2 hours of focal ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). At 2, 6, and 12 hours after reperfusion, the expression and transactivation of NF-kappaB in ischemic versus nonischemic cortex and striatum were determined by immunocytochemistry and by electrophoretic mobility gel-shift analysis. At all time points studied, p50 and p65 immunoreactivity was found exclusively in the nuclei of cortical and striatal neurons in the ischemic hemisphere. The contralateral nonischemic hemisphere showed no evidence of nuclear NF-kappaB immunoreactivity. Double immunofluorescence confirmed expression of p50 in nuclei of neurons. Increased NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in nuclear extracts prepared from the ischemic hemisphere was further substantiated by electrophoretic mobility gel-shift analysis. Because the activation of NF-kappaB by many stimuli can be blocked by antioxidants in vitro, the effect of the antioxidant, LY341122, previously shown to be neuroprotective, on NF-kappaB activation in the MCAO model was evaluated. No significant activation of NF-kappaB was found by electrophoretic mobility gel-shift analysis in animals treated with LY341122. These results demonstrate that transient focal cerebral ischemia results in activation of NF-kappaB in neurons and supports previous observations that neuroprotective antioxidants may inhibit neuronal death by preventing the activation of NF-kappaB.","neurology, neuroscience, metabolism, neurovascular, flow, brain circulation"
"Carbon isotope ratios have been measured for CN in the coma of comet Halley and for several CHON particles emitted by Halley. Of these, only the CHON-particle data may be reasonably related to organic matter in the cometary nucleus, but the true range of 13C/12C values in those particles is quite uncertain. The D/H ratio in H2O in the Halley coma resembles that in Titan/Uranus. The next decade should substantially improve our understanding of the distribution of C, H, N, and O isotopes in cometary organics. The isotopic composition of meteoritic organic matter is better understood and can serve as a useful analog for the cometary case.","organic matter, nitrogen, carbon isotopes, carbon isotope, interplanetary dust, organic material, meteorites"
"To determine the vaccination rates among healthcare workers in the Haifa subdistrict and to assess factors associated with vaccination uptake among them.The study was conducted in the three general hospitals in Haifa City, and in five nursing homes in the Haifa subdistrict. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to 1,014 employees of whom 71% were females, 34% were nurses, 27% were physicians and 28% were non-professional workers.The crude response rate was 66%. Response rates were higher in females (71%) than in males (49%), in nurses (70%) than in physicians (43%), and in staff of internal and pediatric departments than in workers of surgery departments and emergency rooms. The overall vaccination rate among the respondents was 11%, which was higher among males (15%) than among females (10%). No significant relationship between vaccination rate and age, occupation and department was found. The vaccination rate among employees with chronic illness was very low (7%). Influenza vaccine was actively recommended to 29% of the employees. The main reasons for non-compliance were low awareness of the severity of the disease and of the vaccine's efficacy and safety, and unavailability of the vaccine within the workplace.Educational efforts and offering the vaccine at the workplace at no cost are the most important measures for raising influenza vaccination rates.","behaviour, awareness, vaccination, physicians"
"Contributions of entropic modeling to the performance of reactive process control have been investigated. Modeling has been developed based on mass, energy and entropy balances and thermodynamic relations, resulting in a model for the entropy production rate. Using the conventional optimization technique, a minimum for the entropy production rate was found when a given relationship between the temperatures of the inlet stream and of the reaction is satisfied for a particular residence time in the reactor. A new class of nonlinear controller is proposed by means of introducing entropic models into the classical algorithms designed from a synthesis of the reference system. The results indicate that such a controller yields a superior performance when compared with classical feedback control strategies.","feedback control, nonlinear controller, optimization, entropy, modeling, control, control system, satisfiability, residence time, process control, algorithm design, entropy production, thermodynamics"
A design method for the serviceability limit state is presented for steel girders subjected to patch loading. The aim of this method is to give the design engineer a tool that is easy to use to limit irreversible deformation made by travelling patch load. The method is based on a proposed design criterion that no yielding should be allowed in the web plate. Numerical simulation by means of the finite element method is used to define at what load levels first yielding occurs in various girders. By regression analysis closed formulas that predict these load levels were found. Although the residual stresses due to welding are not accounted for in the models used herein it is argued that the resulting formulas still should give a good prediction of which girder geometries have a higher tendency to receive early yielding than others.,"patch loading, plate girders, bridge launching, serviceability limit state, numerical simulation, residual stress, finite element method, regression analysis, design method"

"The through beam connection detail has been identified as an ideal rigid connection for attaching steel beams to concrete filled tube (CFT) columns in seismic regions. This connection detail is also well suited for non-seismic applications. In this research program a combination of analytical and experimental studies was conducted to comprehend the behavior of this detail and develop the accompanying design provisions. The experimental research program is presented elsewhere. In this paper the experimental and analytical results are used to identify the force transfer mechanism within the joint. A model to estimate joint strength is presented and used to develop design guidelines for the through beam connection detail. Calculated results based on the proposed design model are compared with experimental data. Finally, a design example demonstrating the step by step procedures to design the through beam connection detail is presented. Additional research areas necessary to ensure the ductile behavior of the through beam connection in seismic areas are also identified.","concrete filled tube, seismic, force transfer mechanism, through beam connection"
"The ""Deviation Hypothesis"" and some related notions presented by Berg including the contention that test item content is unimportant in personality measurement are critically examined. Some previous findings cited in support of these formulations are briefly reviewed. 2 additional sets of data comparing the effectiveness of test stimuli with different degrees of content relevance are presented. The results clearly indicate that for the criteria and subject populations considered, there exist marked differences in the validities obtainable from different classes of test stimuli--those with the highest degree of judged content relevance producing the most satisfactory results. The theoretical or explanatory value ascribed to the Deviation Hypothesis is called into question.

"Demands for service at a public facility during some unit time are assumed to be independent, normally distributed random variables, with a parabolic mean function of time and constant variance. With the model used, consecutive m -minute demands starting each minute form a non-stationary process, whose mean and covariance functions of time depend on m and on the four other parameters of the distribution function of the unit time demand. Empirical joint distribution functions for the maximum m -minute demand ( m = 1,5) and the total demand for a longer period of time n ( n / m = 3,5,9) were obtained by computer simulation of this process for various values of the parameters corresponding to a wide range of practical situations. The results indicate that counts for both nonoverlapping short time demands and overlapping longer time demands are needed to relate fluctuations in demand to capacity. Also, the choice of the length of observation for the average demand is not very consequential for the variance of the observed ratio of the maximum fluctuations to the average demand or the variance of its difference with the appropriate fraction of the average, although the former tends to be smaller for longer observations of the maximum demand.","modification, stochastic processes, demand, mathematical models, stochastic process, mathematical model, public transit, simulation"
"The increased use of digital processing techniques in Medical Radiations imaging modalities, along with the rapid advance in information technology has resulted in a significant change in the delivery of radiographic teaching programs. This paper details a methodology used to concurrently educate radiographers in both computer programming and image processing. The students learn to program in visual basic applications (VBA), and the programming skills are contextualised by requiring the students to write a digital subtraction angiography (DSA) package. Program code generation and image presentation interface is undertaken by the spreadsheet Microsoft Excel. The user-friendly nature of this common interface enables all students to readily begin program creation. The teaching of programming and image processing skills by this method may be readily generalised to other vocational fields where digital image manipulation is a professional requirement.","digital subtraction angiography, visual basic, computer programming education, image processing, radiographic education, digital image processing, code generation, information technology, digital image"

A theoretical model that calculates deformations and strength of beam-column in fire and fire resistance is described in this paper. A comparison of results calculated using this model with the results of tests shows good agreement. Based on the theoretical model, the influence of the changing strength of the materials, sectional dimensions, steel ratio, load eccentricity and slenderness ratio on the fire resistance are discussed.

"A general methodology for optimization of complex process system via empirical meta-modeling is described. The uniform design and support vector machine are used to build a meta-model of the system, and the meta-model as fitness function is incorporated into genetic algorithm. This optimization methodology involves data collection from the process simulation model or real operation, and fitting to less complex surrogates: meta-model, which is more readily optimized. The use of empirical meta-model allows the optimization to complex process while requiring only a few of solutions to be obtained from the process model. The effectiveness of proposed optimization methodology of complex process system has been proved by optimizing the operating parameters of Puguang high acid natural gas purification plant. The meta-model of whole process has been built by selecting 10 experimental points within the optimizing space of operating parameters. The relative error of predicted value by the meta-model is less than 4%. The optimization results show that the exergy efficiency of purification plant could be increased by 6.6% under the optimum operating point.","Genetic algorithm, Meta-model, Process system optimization, Support vector machine, Uniform design"

The function of a government information service is to supplement and not attempt to supplant the normal channels of communication.

"A relatively high incidence of para-aortic and pelvic lymph node metastasis is found in epithelial ovarian cancer. This paper investigates the clinicomorphological features of intra-abdominal stage I epithelial ovarian cancer that may predict the occurrence of lymph node metastasis and the prognosis of patients in whom lymph node metastases are identified.From November 1988 to December 1997 we performed systematic para-aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy as primary surgery in 47 patients with intra-abdominal stage I epithelial ovarian cancer. The incidence of lymph node metastasis in these patients and the clinicomorphological features of the patients with lymph node involvement were examined.Five patients (10.6%) were metastasis positive (IC: four; IA: one), of whom four had serous adenocarcinoma. Serous adenocarcinoma was associated with a significantly higher incidence of metastases than other histological types (P < 0.05). The number of positive lymph nodes was one in four patients and two in one patient, and the metastatic sites ranged from the para-aortic to the suprainguinal lymph nodes. All five metastasis-positive patients were alive and disease free at the time of this report (survival 28-85 months: median 59 months).This clinical study suggests that serous adenocarcinoma carries a high risk of lymph node metastasis, requiring systematic lymphadenectomy for accurate staging in intra-abdominal stage I epithelial ovarian cancer.","lymph node metastasis, ovarian cancer, systematic lymphadenectomy, prognosis"
"A conceptual framework for planning reproductive health services for refugees is presented for use by those involved in planning field activities. Secondary sources of data are recommended to describe pre-existing patterns and trends in reproductive health status and likely determinants of any change in status, for populations which have been subsequently affected by conflict. The interaction between these patterns and the conflict itself is then analyzed, taking into account the shift in health status and service availability as the conflict progresses through various recognized phases. The potential impact of conflict is thus hypothesized in order to make initial plans for incorporating reproductive health services into standard relief packages. Two case studies are presented: Rwanda demonstrates the use of the framework in a relatively short but dramatic conflict, for which there was also substantial prior evidence on reproductive health status; Cambodia is used, in contrast, to demonstrate the use of the framework in a much more complex conflict which has been occurring over the last 20 years.","reproductive health, refugee, needs assessment, cambodia, rwanda"

This article recognizes the benefits of using an object-oriented framework to modeling information systems. It also recognizes two limitations in the present application of the technique which are not adequately addressed in the current development methods. They include the lack of an unambiguous and systematic approach to object identification and the insufficiency of the object-oriented approach to provide for changes in domain policies in information systems specification. This article aims to address these two limitations. The approach we discuss is based on an object-oriented framework for structuring information systems and a rule-based representational scheme for representing domain policies. The benefits of this marriage of objects and rules are also discussed in this paper.,"interweaving object, information systems development, rule based, information system"
"Homogeneous, shared memory multiprocessors that incorporate real-time operating systems constitute in many corporations the basic platforms for developing applications of plant monitoring and automation. In this work, a template model based on the High Level Petri Net (HLPN) formalism is proposed for this class of computers. Mapping functional and timing requirements of the application software to states of this model and searching for their existence in the reachability tree of the net can verify the satisfaction of these requirements. A state searching algorithm has been developed for the case of a shared memory multiprocessor in which there is a bus-based interconnection network supporting a single communication channel for the exchange of data among the CPUs, the common memory and the computer interfaces. This algorithm groups the infinite number of states of the HLPN to a number of finite regions, identifies the region, which the desired state belongs to, and checks for the existence of a path from the initial state that leads to this region. In order to demonstrate the use of the template in the modeling and verification of timing and functional specifications of a system of the considered class, the implementation of the automation functions of a chemical reactor by a VME-bus based multiprocessor with two CPUs and running under the control of the OS-9 operating system was studied. In this study the template model was used to create a specific for this application HLPN model. The response times of two automation functions were predicted by the use of this model and compared with those derived from the operating characteristics of the reactor.","high level petri net, multiprocessor systems, initial state, os-9 operating system, high level petri nets, performance analysis, automation function, template model, real-time operating system, shared memory multiprocessor, shared memory multiprocessors, operating characteristic, requirements verification, common memory, application hlpn model, real-time system, chemical reactors, communication channels, search algorithm, real time operating system, operating system, real time systems"
"Cross-species gene-expression comparison is a powerful tool for the discovery of evolutionarily conserved mechanisms and pathways of expression control. The usefulness of cDNA microarrays in this context is that broad areas of homology are compared and hybridization probes are sufficiently large that small inter-species differences in nucleotide sequence would not affect the analytical results. This comparative genomics approach would allow a common set of genes within a specific developmental, metabolic, or disease-related gene pathway to be evaluated in experimental models of human diseases. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility and reproducibility of cross-species analysis employing a human cDNA microarray as probe.As a proof of principle, total RNA derived from human and bovine fetal brains was used as a source of labelled targets for hybridisation onto a human cDNA microarray composed of 349 characterised genes. Each gene was spotted 20 times representing 6,980 data points thus enabling highly reproducible spot quantification. Employing high stringency hybridisation and washing conditions, followed by data analysis, revealed slight differences in the expression levels and reproducibility of the signals between the two species. We also assigned each of the genes into three expression level categories- i.e. high, medium and low. The correlation co-efficient of cross hybridisation between the orthologous genes was 0.94. Verification of the array data by semi-quantitative RT-PCR using common primer sequences enabled co-amplification of both human and bovine transcripts. Finally, we were able to assign gene names to previously uncharacterised bovine ESTs.Results of our study demonstrate the harnessing and utilisation power of comparative genomics and prove the feasibility of using human microarrays to facilitate the identification of co-expressed orthologous genes in common tissues derived from different species.","microarrays, proteomics, feasibility studies, gene expression, nucleic acid hybridization, brain chemistry, genes, nucleotide sequence, gene expression regulation, genetic variation, comparative genomics, data analysis, gene expression profiling, microarray analysis, proof of principle, sequence alignment"
"The beta agonist fenoterol, the antimuscarinic ipratropium bromide and their combination were compared in 10 patients with stable reversible airway obstruction. A single-blind cross-over design was used in order to obtain cumulative dose-response curves. The dose inhaled by an IPPB apparatus on different days were: fenoterol, from 12.5 to 1.600 cumulate micrograms; ipratropium bromide, from 5 to 640 cumulate micrograms; combination (5:2), from 17.5 to 1.120 cumulate micrograms. The bronchodilator effect was measured as changes of FEV1 and of SGaw. Data were processed in order to identify the median effective dose (ED50) and the percentage change at ED50 (RED50). The mean ED50 in micrograms (+/- SD) resulted in: Fenoterol, ED50 (FEV1) = 132 (+/- 46); ED50 (SGaw) = 172 (+/- 62); Ipratropium bromide, ED50 (FEV1) = 14 (+/- 7); ED50 (SGaw) = 23 (+/- 11); Combination, ED50 (FEV1) = 109 (+/- 26); ED50 (SGaw) = 121 (+/- 53). The mean RED50% (+/- SD) resulted in: Fenoterol, RED50 (FEV1) = 30 (+/- 16); RED50 (SGaw) = 106 (+/- 78); Ipratropium bromide, RED50 (FEV1) = 21 (+/- 10); RED50 (SGaw) = 82 (+/- 66); Combination, RED50 (FEV1) = 35 (+/- 11) RED50 (SGaw) = 135 (+/- 81). The ED50 (FEV1) of the combination was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than that of fenoterol. This increased potency of the combination supports evidence for an overadditive interaction between fenoterol and ipratropium bromide. Moreover, the efficacy of fenoterol (RED50) is enhanced by combining the two drugs.","dose response relationship, cumulant, effective dose, dose response"
"Abstract A 5-year-old girl presented with a 3-year history of severe trichotillomania and alopecia. The trichotillomania was observed to covary, or occur only in the presence of thumb-sucking. Thus, the elimination of thumb-sucking was targeted as a treatment for trichotillomania. The investigation evaluated the relative effectiveness of a standard aversive taste treatment, a response-dependent alarm and a response-disrupting thumb-post. Results indicated that only the thumb-post completely eliminated thumb-sucking and the covarying trichotillomania. These results suggest that when trichotillomania is a benign habit disorder, the treatment of a covarying habit such as thumb-sucking can be an effective treatment alternative and that resilient thumb-sucking can be effectively managed with an easily implemented thumb-post that requires little supervision and provides long-term success.","thumb-sucking, habit disorder, trichotillomani, covariation"
"Until very recently, the term Lewis acidic ionic liquids (ILs) was nearly synonymous with halometallate ILs, with a strong focus on chloroaluminate(III) systems. The first part of this review covers the historical context in which these were developed, speciation of a range of halometallate ionic liquids, attempts to quantify their Lewis acidity, and selected recent applications: in industrial alkylation processes, in supported systems (SILPs/SCILLs) and in inorganic synthesis. In the last decade, interesting alternatives to halometallate ILs have emerged, which can be divided into two sub-sections: (1) liquid coordination complexes (LCCs), still based on halometallate species, but less expensive and more diverse than halometallate ionic liquids, and (2) ILs with main-group Lewis acidic cations. The two following sections cover these new liquid Lewis acids, also highlighting speciation studies, Lewis acidity measurements, and applications.","Lewis acidity, Halometallate ionic liquids, Liquid coordination complexes, Solvate ionic liquids, Borenium cations"
"For several years, a growing number of children raised in lesbian families have been noticed. Even if this number is not really known, it appears clearly that more and more psychiatrists will have to care for children which will present this family configuration. The problem then is to know if this type of education has an incident on the psychopathology of children or not. The purpose of this article is not to give answer or to take side but just to help physicians to make a point of what is known about this subject in international literature.","ergonomics, suicide prevention, human factors, injury prevention, occupational safety"
The main goal of reuse reengineering processes for existing software is to obtain reusable software modules by clustering old software components that implement functional or data abstractions. The first problem to solve in the functional abstraction is how to search old software for components that may constitute a module. This article proposes candidature criteria founded on the dominance relation between the nodes of a call-directed graph. The proposed criteria have been adopted in a real-life reuse reengineering process on PASCAL software.,"call dominance tree, software salvaging, directed graph, software component"
"Abstract Objective: There has been an increasing trend for Caesarean deliveries in twin pregnancies over the last decades; preferred mode of delivery is still unclear. The article presents the mode of twin delivery within intact amniotic sac. Methods: The intrapartum courses in 70 matched twin pairs extracted by Caesarean section were analysed. Neonates were distributed to two groups - main (delivered ""en caul"") and control (delivered by conventional Caesarean section) groups, and subdivided according to gestational age at the time of delivery: 28-30 weeks, 31-33 weeks and 34-37 weeks. Neonates delivered first and second were matched by pairs. Results: The duration of Caesarean section was higher in the main group (delivered ""en caul""). Apgar score at 5-th min depend on the gestational age at birth and was higher in main group. Mechanical ventilation term and length of hospital stay were lower in main group. Postnatal neurological examination showed lower incidence of brain damage in the main group. During the first year of life, neonates extracted within intact amniotic sac showed lower morbidity rate. This was correct also for pairs of neonates matched by delivery order. Conclusions: Presented method improves neonates' Apgar score, reduces the need for resuscitation and influence of intrapartum negative factors. The length of hospital stay and hospitalisation rate for the first year of life were also lower in neonates delivered ""en caul"", providing an economical benefit.","caesarean, en caul, intact membranes, twin"
"A community-based health-care assessment model and method are presented. The model and method are based on theoretical notion that community residents' satisfaction with individual health-care programs and services available within their community affect their satisfaction with the community health-care system. Examples of individual health-care services and programs include: drug abuse programs, cancer health services, children health services, diabetes services, elderly health programs, emergency health services, physical fitness programs, heart health programs, home health services, mental health services, in-patient hospital services, obstetrics services, out-patient services, physical rehabilitation services, and women's health programs. In turn, satisfaction with over-all community health care affects perceived quality of life (over-all life satisfaction) through satisfaction with the community at large and satisfaction with personal health. Data were collected in the Mid-Atlantic area of the United States through a mail survey. One-hundred and forty-seven community residents completed the survey. The results were supportive of the model and provided validational support to the assessment method. Managerial implications of the model and its application are also discussed.","physical fitness, health care, drug abuse, quality of life"
"In this paper, we investigate the customers using the services offered by the electronic grocery stores (EGS) in the greater Helsinki area. The study aims at revealing the benefits of the EGS service and problems that the customers have faced when shopping in the EGS. The empirical consumer data was gathered in the metropolitan area of Helsinki, Finland, in spring 1999. The EGSs in Finland are not able to produce any remarkable value added for consumers today. An EGS could produce value added for consumer by offering differentiated products and services for various consumer groups.","consumer behaviour, shopping, electronic grocery stores, retailing, internet, differentiated products, value added"
"To describe the kinds of unintended consequences related to the implementation of computerized provider order entry (CPOE) in the outpatient setting.Ethnographic and interview data were collected by an interdisciplinary team over a 7 month period at four clinics.Instances of unintended consequences were categorized using an expanded Diffusion of Innovations theory framework.The framework was clarified and expanded. There are both desirable and undesirable unintended consequences, and they can be either direct or indirect, but there are also many consequences that are not clearly either desirable or undesirable or may even be both, depending on one's perspective. The undesirable consequences include error and security concerns and issues related to alerts, workflow, ergonomics, interpersonal relations, and reimplementations.Consequences of implementing and reimplementing clinical systems are complex. The expanded Diffusion of Innovations theory framework is a useful tool for analyzing such consequences.","medical records systems, online systems, computerized, computerized physician order entry, hospital information systems online systems medical records systems computerized computerized physician order entry, hospital information systems, interpersonal relations"
"Superficial lumps and bumps are extremely common in children, and the vast majority ultimately prove to be benign. Duplex/color Doppler ultrasound (US) has emerged as the first-line imaging modality for the evaluation of these superficial pediatric masses because it provides a means for rapid acquisition of information including size, shape, location, internal content and vascularity. More important, it does so without utilizing radiation, iodinated contrast material or sedation/anesthesia. In this review, we present the sonographic findings of a variety of cases ranging from head to toe that are either uncommonly seen or were diagnosed in an atypical fashion (i.e. ultrasound). In situations where the lesion is too deep, hyperechoic or large to be fully assessed within the field of view or if malignancy is suspected, then additional cross-sectional imaging is warranted for further evaluation.","Bump, Children, Hernia, Lump, Mass, Superficial, Ultrasound"
"Alterations in patellar height after high tibial osteotomy are found in many instances. Fibrosis of the tendon is implicated as the cause of the mechanism of patella lowering. This study aimed to determine the relationship between the position of the patella and the histopathological findings at the patellar tendon after high tibial osteotomy.Nineteen knees in seventeen patients who were consecutively hospitalised for implant extraction are studied. All of the patients had previously undergone closing wedge osteotomy by the same surgeon at the same department. The median follow-up time is 15 months (range: 11-35). Five patients who all underwent high tibial osteotomy at the same time are also included in the study as a control group for histopathological evaluation. All of the patients are evaluated radiologically, patellar tendon biopsies are taken during the operation, and histopathological analyses are performed.The shortening of the patellar tendon is statistically significant (P < 0.05). The severity of the vascularisation, inflammation, and fibrotic change observed at the distal part of the tendon is evident. However, there is no statistically significant correlation between these findings and the degree of shortening.The shortening of the tendon occurs as a result of adherence in the distal part of the tendon. It would appear that it is this shortening that causes the difficulties encountered during arthroplasty surgery of osteotomy patients, and not patella infera.","Patella infera, High tibial osteotomy, Closing wedge osteotomy, Patellar tendon"
